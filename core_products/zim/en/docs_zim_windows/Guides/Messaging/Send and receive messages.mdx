# Send & Receive messages

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides the capability of message management, allowing you to send and receive one-to-one, group, in-room messages, query message history, delete messages, and more. With the message management feature, you can meet different requirements of various scenarios such as social entertainment, online shopping, online education, interactive live streaming, and more. 

This document describes how to send, receive and listen for the status of messages with the ZIM SDK.

## Send/Receive regular messages

Regular messages refer to the messages of the following message types: ZIMTextMessage and ZIMBarrageMessage.

<Warning title="Warning">

- To receive event callbacks (receive messages, get connection status, and receive a notification when Token is about to expire, etc.), you can set up the [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler) method and listen for related events. 
- When receiving messages, you need to determine the message is a Text message ([ZIMTextMessage](@-ZIMTextMessage)) or a Command message ([ZIMCommandMessage](@-ZIMCommandMessage)) because these two message types are based on the basic message class ([ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage)). You need to convert the basic message class to a concrete message type and then retrieve the message content from the `message` field.
- When a message is received, it can be sorted using the message's `orderKey`. The larger the `orderKey`, the newer the message. And the number of unread messages will be updated automatically upon receiving.
</Warning>


## Send/Receive messages

The following process shows how Client A sends messages to Client B:

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/In_app_Chat/14226.png" /></Frame>

1. Client A and Client B create their own ZIM SDK instances, and set up an event handler [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler) to listen for related events (receive one-to-one messages, get connection status, and receive the notification when Token is about to expire).
2. Client A and Client B log in to the ZIM SDK.
3. Client A calls the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method to send a one-to-one message to Client B.
4. Client B listens for the [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler) method to receive Client A's one-to-one messages.

<Warning title="Warning">

You can't send messages to yourself by calling the `sendMessage` method (when toConversationID = your ID). If you did so, the error code 6000001 will return. 

</Warning>


<CodeGroup>
```cpp SampleCode
// 1. Create a ZIM object and pass in appID and appSign. Currently, it is only recommended that one client create a zim instance.
zim::ZIMAppConfig app_config;
app_config.appID = 12345;     //Replace with the AppID you applied for
app_config.appSign = "appSign";   //Replace with the AppSign you applied for
zim_ = zim::ZIM::create(app_config);

// 2. Set up a setEventHandler.
im_event_handler_ = std::make_shared<CZIMEventHandler>();
zim_->setEventHandler(im_event_handler_);

// 3. Log in.
zim::ZIMUserInfo user_info;
user_info.userID = user_id;
user_info.userName = user_name;

zim_->login(user_info, [=](zim::ZIMError errorInfo){
  // You can be told whether the login is successful according to the ZIMError.
});

// 4. Send regular message.
zim::ZIMMessage* message = nullptr;
zim::ZIMTextMessage text_message;
text_message.message = "message";
// Set the message priority.
zim::ZIMMessageSendConfig config;
config.priority = zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_LOW;
message = &text_message;

// Send one-on-one messages. 
zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_PEER

// Send group messages. 
zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_GROUP

// Send in-room messages.
zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_ROOM

// 5. Send messages.
zim_->sendMessage(message, "toConversationID", type, config, notification,
                  [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message,
                            const zim::ZIMError &errorInfo) { int i = 0; });
```
</CodeGroup>

### Receive messages

<Note title="Note">

- To send messages, call the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method and set the `ZIMConversationType` accordingly.
- To receive messages:
    - One-on-one messages (Peer type), through the callback [onReceivePeerMessage](@onReceivePeerMessage).
    - In-room messages (Room type), through the callback [onReceiveRoomMessage](@onReceiveRoomMessage).
    - Group messages (Group type), through the callback [onReceiveGroupMessage](@onReceiveGroupMessage).
</Note>

```cpp
// Callback for receiving one-to-one messages.
void onReceivePeerMessage(ZIM *zim*,
                         const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<ZIMMessage>> & messageList,
                         const std::string &fromUserID) {
    //Implement the callback handling logic for receiving one-to-one messages here.
}
```

## Send and receive rich media messages

The ZIM SDK supports sending various types of rich media messages, including images, files, audio, video, and more. Developers can follow the steps below to implement the sending and receiving of rich media file messages.

After a user successfully logs in, specify the message type (image, file, audio, video), conversation type (one-on-one chat, room, group), etc., and send the rich media message to the designated conversation.
After the receiving user successfully logs in, listen for relevant callbacks based on the conversation type (one-on-one chat, room, group) to receive notifications for rich media messages and download the rich media message files locally.



### Send rich media content


To send rich media content after login, call the [sendMediaMessage](@sendMediaMessage) method, and specify the message type (image, file, audio, video), the session type (one-on-one chat, room chat, group chat), and message related configurations as needed.

<Warning title="Warning">

- When sending rich media content, the file path to be sent must be in `UTF-8` encoding format.
- To send rich media content to a room/group, the sender must be in the room/group.
</Warning>

        int code = errorInfo.code;
    });
```
</details>

#### Sending progress callback for rich media file messages

Developers can receive relevant notifications about the upload and sending progress of rich media messages through the [ZIMMediaUploadingProgress](@ZIMMediaUploadingProgress) callback.

``` cpp
using ZIMMediaUploadingProgress =
    std::function<void(const std::shared_ptr<ZIMMessage> &message, long long currentSize,
                       long long totalSize)>;
```

Among which：
- message: The content of the message being sent.
- currentSize: The current size of the message that has been sent.
- totalSize: The total size of the message being sent.

### Receive rich media content

To receive the rich media content messages, do the following:
1. Listen for the following callbacks based on the session type (one-on-one chat, room chat, group chat): [onReceivePeerMessage](@onReceivePeerMessage), [onReceiveRoomMessage](@onReceiveRoomMessage), [onReceiveGroupMessage](@onReceiveGroupMessage).
2. Call the [downloadMediaFile](@downloadMediaFile) method to download the rich media content.

When downloading rich media content, you need to specify the file type of the corresponding media messages first.

- Image messages: You can choose to download the original file, large view, or thumbnail.
- Files/Audio messages: Only original files/audio files can be downloaded.
- Video messages: You can choose to download the original video file and the thumbnail of the first frame of the video.


<CodeGroup>
``` cpp SampleCode
// Receive rich media content in one-on-one chat - Receive images 
void onReceivePeerMessage(
    zim::ZIM *zim, const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage>> &messageList,
    const std::string &fromUserID) {
    
    for (auto &it : messageList) {
        if (it->getType() == zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_IMAGE) {
            auto media_message = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<zim::ZIMImageMessage>(it);

            zim_->downloadMediaFile(
                    media_message.get(),
                    zim::ZIMMediaFileType::ZIM_Media_File_Type_Original_Image,
                    [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message, unsigned int currentSize,
                        unsigned int totalSize) {

                    },
                    [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message,
                        const zim::ZIMError &errorInfo) {

                    });
        }
    }

}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Downloading progress callback for rich media file messages

Developers can receive relevant notifications about the download progress of rich media messages through the `onMediaUploadingProgress` callback of [ZIMMediaMessageSendNotification](@-ZIMMediaMessageSendNotification).

``` cpp
using ZIMMediaDownloadingProgress =
    std::function<void(const std::shared_ptr<ZIMMessage> &message, unsigned int currentSize,
                       unsigned int totalSize)>;
```
	
Among which:
- message: The message content you are downloading.
- currentSize: The size of messages that have been downloaded.
- totalSize: The overall size of the download message.

## Send/Receive signaling messages


The ZIM SDK now supports you to send and receive signaling messages. To do that, you can call the [ZIMCommandMessage](@-ZIMCommandMessage) to define the message type you want to send, for example, your location information.

<Note title="Note">

This message type does not support offline push and local storage.
</Note>

The following shows**how to send signaling messages to a specified user**.

### Send signaling messages

```cpp
// Send signaling messages to a specified user.
zim::ZIMMessage *message = nullptr;
zim::ZIMCommandMessage commandMessage;

zim::ZIMMessageSendConfig sendConfig;
zim::ZIMPushConfig pushConfig;

pushConfig.content = "win_push_content";
pushConfig.extendedData = "win_push_extended_data";
pushConfig.title = "win_push_title";

sendConfig.priority = zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_MEDIUM;
sendConfig.pushConfig = &pushConfig;

std::vector<uint8_t> uint8Message;
uint8Message.assign(strMessage.begin(), strMessage.end());
commandMessage.message = uint8Message;

message = &commandMessage;

// Send one-to-one messages 
zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_PEER

// Send group messages
// zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_GROUP

// Send room messages
// zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_ROOM

auto notification = std::make_shared<zim::ZIMMessageSendNotification>(
            [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message) { int i = 0; });

// Send messages
zim_->sendMessage(message, "toConversationID", type, config, notification,
                    [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message,
                              const zim::ZIMError &errorInfo) { int i = 0; });
```

### Receive signaling messages

```cpp
//Receive signaling messages.
void OnReceivePeerMessage(zim::ZIM *zim, const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage>> &message_list, 
                          const std::string &from_user_id){
    for (auto &it : message_list) {
        if (it->getType() == zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_COMMAND) {
            auto commandMessage = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<zim::ZIMCommandMessage>(it);
            
        }
    }
}
```

## Sending and Receiving Custom Messages

The ZIM SDK supports developers to send and receive custom types of messages. Developers can define their own message types, such as voting types, chain types, video card types, etc., using the [ZIMCustomMessage](@-ZIMCustomMessage) object. Developers can follow the steps below to implement the sending and receiving of custom messages.

<Note title="Note">

- Only ZIM SDK versions 2.8.0 and above support sending custom type messages and receiving and viewing the content of custom type messages.
- If the SDK version of the receiving end is between [2.0.0, 2.8.0), it can receive custom messages, but the message type will be displayed as unknown and the information content cannot be obtained. To obtain this message, please upgrade the SDK to version 2.8.0 or above.
- If the SDK version of the receiving end is version 1.x.x, it cannot receive custom messages and will not receive unknown messages.
</Note>

### Sending Custom Messages

The interface used to send custom messages is [sendMessage](@sendMessage), which is the same as the interface used to send normal messages. Developers can refer to [Sending Messages in Sending and Receiving Normal Messages](#send-rich-media-content) for details of this interface parameters.

Developers need to define custom type messages through the [ZIMCustomMessage](@-ZIMCustomMessage) object.

The following is an example code for users to send custom messages in a one-on-one chat session:

```cpp
// Send custom message to specified user
zim::ZIMMessage *message = nullptr;
zim::ZIMCustomMessage customMessage;

zim::ZIMMessageSendConfig sendConfig;
zim::ZIMPushConfig pushConfig;

pushConfig.content = "win_push_content";
pushConfig.extendedData = "win_push_extended_data";
pushConfig.title = "win_push_title";

sendConfig.priority = zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_MEDIUM;
sendConfig.pushConfig = &pushConfig;

std::string message = "message";
unsigned int subType = 1;
std::string searchedContent = "searchedContent";

customMessage.message = message;
customMessage.subType = subType;
customMessage.searchedContent = searchedContent;

message = &customMessage;

// Send one-on-one message
zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_PEER

// Send group message
// zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_GROUP

// Send room message
// zim::ZIMConversationType type = zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_ROOM

auto notification = std::make_shared<zim::ZIMMessageSendNotification>(
            [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message) { int i = 0; });

// 5. Send message
zim_->sendMessage(message, "toConversationID", type, config, notification,
                    [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message,
                              const zim::ZIMError &errorInfo) { int i = 0; });
```

### Receiving Custom Messages

The callback interface for receiving custom messages is the same as the callback interface for receiving normal messages. Please refer to [Receiving Messages in Sending and Receiving Normal Messages](#receive-rich-media-content) for the specific interface.

The following is an example code for users to receive custom messages in a one-on-one chat session:

```cpp
// User receives custom messages
void OnReceivePeerMessage(zim::ZIM *zim, const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage>> &message_list, 
                          const std::string &from_user_id){
    for (auto &it : message_list) {
        if (it->getType() == zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_CUSTOM) {
            auto commandMessage = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<zim::ZIMCustomMessage>(it);
            
        }
    }
}
```

## Send and Receive @ Messages

An "@" message refers to a message that contains the content of "@ + user". When a user is mentioned with an "@" message, they receive a strong notification.

<Note title="Note">

The "@" message is not a message type itself. A message can be both a text message or another type of message, and it can also be an "@" message.
</Note>

### Send @ messages

When calling [sendMessage](@sendMessage) to send a message, you can use the following[ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage)  parameters (can be used simultaneously) to mark a message as an "@" message:
- [mentionedUserIDs](@mentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage): Notifies specific users (including users outside of the session) to view the message. The length of the userID list passed in should be up to 50. If you need to increase this limit, please contact the ZEGOCLOUD technical support team.
- [isMentionAll](@isMentionAll-ZIMMessage)： Notifies all other users within the session to view the message.

<Note title="Note">

Only ZIM SDK version 2.14.0 and above supports sending messages with @ information.
</Note>

```cpp
// Create a reminder user list
std::vector<std::string> mentionArrayList;

// Add a reminder to the user (the user does not need to be in the current session)
mentionArrayList.push_back("userId1");
mentionArrayList.push_back("userId2");

// message can be any type of message
message->mentionedUserIDs = mentionArrayList;

// Remind all other users in the session to view the message
bool isMentionAll = true;
message->isMentionAll = true;

ZIMMessageSendConfig config;
// Set the message priority
config.priority = ZIMMessagePriority::LOW;

// Whether to forcefully push the notification to the alerted user (regardless of whether the other party has enabled Do Not Disturb mode), defaulting to false;
config.isNotifyMentionedUsers = true;

// Take sending one-to-one chat messages as an example
ZIMConversationType type = ZIMConversationType::Peer;

zim_->sendMessage(
    message, "conv_id", type, config,
    std::make_shared<zim::ZIMMessageSendNotification>(
        [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message) {
            if (message) {
                // Developers can use this callback to listen for whether a message is starting to prepare for sending. This callback is only triggered for messages that pass the local basic parameter validation. Otherwise, errors will be thrown through the onMessageSent callback.
            }
        }),
    [=](std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> message, zim::ZIMError errorInfo) {
        // Developers can use this callback to monitor whether the message is sent successfully.
        if (errorInfo.code == zim::ZIMErrorCode::ZIM_ERROR_CODE_SUCCESS) {
            
        }
    });
```

### Receive @ messages


The callback interface for receiving @ messages is the same as the callback interface for receiving regular messages. Please refer to [Send & Receive messages - Receive messages](#receive-rich-media-content) for details on the specific interface.

After receiving a message, developers can implement corresponding functionalities based on their business logic, such as highlighting, etc.

<Note title="Note">

- Only ZIM SDK versions 2.14.0 and above support receiving and viewing the content of @ messages.
- If the SDK version on the receiving end is between [2.0.0, 2.14.0), the received messages and conversations will not contain @ information.
- If the SDK version on the receiving end is version 1.x.x, @ messages cannot be received.
</Note>

### Receive mentionedInfoList

After users within a session are mentioned, developers can passively or actively retrieve [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation).

[mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation) contains the corresponding message ID, sender userID, and the type of [ZIMMessageMentionedType](@-ZIMMessageMentionedType). Developers can use this information to implement various business logics, such as marking conversations.

#### Passive retrieval

When a user is mentioned, the [conversationChanged](https://www.zegocloud.com/article/apidoc=zim_API~objective-c_ios~protocol~ZIMEventHandler#zim-conversation-changed) will be received, allowing you to retrieve the latest [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation) for the current [ZIMConversation](@-ZIMConversation).

```cpp
void onConversationChanged(
        ZIM * /*zim*/,
        const std::vector<ZIMConversationChangeInfo> & /*conversationChangeInfoList*/) {
    // Retrieve mentionInfoList from the conversationChangeInfoList of the mentioned conversation
}
```

#### Active retrieval

If you use [queryConversationList](@queryConversationList) or [queryConversation](@queryConversation) o actively fetch conversations, you can also retrieve the [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation) within the conversation. Refer to the following example code:


```cpp
std::vector<ZIMMessageMentionedInfo> mentionedInfoList = conversation.mentionedInfoList;
```

### Clearing mentionedInfoList of a conversation

After receiving @ messages, users need to clear the [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList) of a conversation to stop receiving notifications.

The interface for clearing the mentionedInfoList  is the same as clearing the unread message count of a conversation:
- [clearConversationUnreadMessageCount](@clearConversationUnreadMessageCount): Clears the unread message count of a single conversation. Refer to the example code in [Manage sessions - Clear single session message unread](./../Conversation/Get%20the%20conversation%20list.mdx).
- [clearConversationTotalUnreadMessageCount](@clearConversationTotalUnreadMessageCount): Clears the total unread message count of all conversations. Refer to the example code in [Manage sessions - Clear all unread conversation messages](./../Conversation/Get%20the%20conversation%20list.mdx).

### Get the reminder user list


All users within the conversation can use the [mentionedUserIDs](@mentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage) parameter of [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage) to obtain the specific list of mentioned users. However, this interface only returns the user list passed in through the [MentionedUserIDs](@MentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage) of [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage).

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> userIds = message.mentionedUserIDs;
```

### Confirm whether it is a reminder for all members

All users within the conversation can use the [isMentionAll](@isMentionAll-ZIMMessage) parameter of [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage)to determine whether it is a reminder for all members. 

```cpp
boolean isMentionAll = message.isMentionAll;
```

## Send and receiving broadcast messages


ZIM allows you to send messages to all online users of your app from the server side, and the targeted users will receive the messages through the client side.

### Send messages to all users from the server side

Please refer to the server-side API documentation [Push message to all user](/zim-server/push-message-to-all-users) to learn how to send messages to all users from the server side.

### Receive broadcast messages sent from the server side

<Note title="Note">

- Only ZIM SDK versions 2.10.0 and above support receiving and viewing the content of broadcast messages sent from the server side.
 - If the SDK version on the receiving end is between [2.0.0, 2.10.0), broadcast messages sent from the server side cannot be received. If you need to access this message, please upgrade the SDK to version 2.10.0 or above. 
</Note>

Through the [onBroadcastMessageReceived](@onBroadcastMessageReceived)  callback, you can receive push messages from all members.

Sample code：
```cpp
// User receives broadcast messages
virtual void onBroadcastMessageReceived(ZIM * /*zim*/,
                                        const std::shared_ptr<ZIMMessage> & /*message*/) {}
```

## Forward message

The ZIM SDK supports forwarding messages in one of the following ways: 

- Combining messages and forwarding the combined message. 
- Forwarding messages one by one.

For more information, see [Forward messages](./Forward%20messages.mdx).

## Receive Tips message


ZIM SDK supports converting user operations within a session into Tips messages. When a related operation occurs, ZIM SDK will send a Tips message to the session to notify. For details, please refer to [Receive tip messages](./Receive%20tip%20messages.mdx).

## Listen for the message status 

On a weak network condition, this may happen: the ZIM SDK doesn't receive the response from the server for some reason (e.g., packet loss), while the message is successfully sent. In this case, the ZIM SDK considers the message sending failed due to the reply timeout, but the message is actually sent successfully, which results in message status confusion.
To solve this and Clarify the message status, the SDK 2.6.0 or later now allows you to listen for the [onMessageSentStatusChanged](@onMessageSentStatusChanged) callback to receive the changes of the message status.
And we now have three different message statuses: Sending, Success, and Failed.
You can know whether your message is sent successfully by the status, and implement your event handling logic as needed.

```cpp
// Listen for the message status.
void onMessageSentStatusChanged(zim::ZIM *zim, const std::vector<ZIMMessageSentStatusChangeInfo> &messageSentStatusChangeInfoList{
    // You can listen for the callback on the changes of message status here.
}
```
