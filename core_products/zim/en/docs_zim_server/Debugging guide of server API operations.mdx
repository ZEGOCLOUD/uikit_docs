# Debugging guide of server API operations

- - -



This topic describes how to use Postman to debug server API operations.

Postman allows you to debug server API operations on a GUI in a convenient and visualized manner.

ZEGO Instant Messaging (ZIM) provides a Postman collection to help you debug server API operations. In the Postman collection, the request parameters of each operation are predefined. After you import the Postman collection, you need to only modify the parameter values to debug server API operations.

## 1\. Prerequisites

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is downloaded and installed.
- The [Postman collection package](https://storage.zego.im/zim/postman/ZIM_postman_collection.zip) of the server API of ZIM is downloaded and decompressed.
- You have logged in to the [ZEGO console](https://console.zego.im) and obtained the parameters, such as `AppId` and `ServerSecret`, that are required to call an API operation.

<Warning title="Warning">

- The client UI of the Postman plug-in varies based on the platform. In this example, the Postman plug-in of the macOS operating system is used.
- The provided Postman collection is only for debugging and does not contain all operations of the server API.

</Warning>

## 2\. Import and configure the Postman collection

3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Environments**. Then, select the **ZIM** environment. In the **CURRENT VALUE** column of the corresponding environment variable, enter the application ID and the server secret that are obtained in the [1. Prerequisites](#1-prerequisites) section. After you configure the settings, click **Save**.![/Pics/ZIM/postman/postman_setenv.png](https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/ZIM/postman/postman_setenv.png)

## 3\. Debug API operations

This section describes how to use Postman to debug server API operations. Several operations are used in the example.

<Note title="Note">
The double braces `{{xxxx}}` in the **VALUE** column of some parameters indicate that the parameter values are environment variables. You do not need to modify the parameter values.
