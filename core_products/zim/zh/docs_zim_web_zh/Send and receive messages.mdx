## Solution 

The following shows the access solution that ZEGOCLOUD'S In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides.  

![/Pics/InappChat/im_solution_en.png](https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/InappChat/im_solution_en.png)

In this solution, you will need to implement the following business logic based on your actual business requirements: 

- The logic for managing the users on the client, and the logic for distributing user ID for users to log in. 
- The logic for generating the **Token** for SDK to authenticate the user. We recommend you implement the logic for generating tokens on your app server for data security.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

- Go to [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com), and do the following:
  - Create a project, get the **AppID** and **ServerSecret**.
  - Activate the **In-app Chat** service (as shown in the following figure).

- Get the **Token** that SDK required for login authentication. For details, see [Authentication](./Guides/Users/Authentication.mdx).

## Integrate the SDK

### Optional: Create a new project

Skip to this step if a project already exists.

<details class="zg-primary">
    <summary>Create a new project</summary>

1. Create a folder as the basic audio and video project folder as shown below: 

    ```bash
    ├── assets
    │   ├── css
    │   │   └── index.css # Used to set the page style.
    │   └── js
    │       ├── biz.js    # The JavaScript code that is used to implement the features.
    │       └── zim.js    # zim sdk
    ├── index.html        # The front page file of the application
    ```

2. Copy the following code to the `index.html` file.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" />
        <meta name="renderer" content="webkit" />
        <title>ZIM</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/index.css" />
    </head>

    <body></body>

    <script src="./assets/js/zim.js"></script>
    <script src="./assets/js/biz.js"></script>
    </html>
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` on the local browser.

### Import the SDK 

Choose either of the following methods to integrate the SDK into your project.

#### Method 1: Integrate the SDK manually

1. Download and extract the latest version of SDK from [SDK downloads](./Client%20SDKs/SDK%20downloads.mdx).


2. Import the SDK using the following script.

    ```html
    <!-- Path to index.html corresponding to zim SDK -->
    <script src="./zego-zim-web/index.js"></script>
    ```

#### Method 2: Integrate the SDK with NPM

1. Execute the `npm i zego-zim-web` command to install the dependencies.

    <Note title="Note">

    - We recommend you use the NPM package that supports the TypeScript language.
    - If the error `permission denied` occurs when executing the npm command on macOS or Linux, add a `sudo` before the npm command and try again.
    </Note>

2. Import the SDK.

    ```javascript
    import { ZIM } from 'zego-zim-web';
    ```
   
    or

    ```javascript
    const ZIM = require('zego-zim-web').ZIM;
    ```

## Implementation steps

### Get the sample code

To download and run the sample code, see [Sample app](./Sample%20app.mdx).


### Import the SDK file 

Refer to the [**Method 2: Integrate the SDK with NPM**](#method-2-integrate-the-sdk-with-npm) to import the SDK package file. 


### Create a ZIM SDK instance

Creating a ZIM instance is the very first step, an instance corresponds to a user logging in to the system as a client.

So, let's suppose we have two clients now, client A and client B. To send and receive messages to each other, both of them will need to call the [create](@create) method with the AppID in the previous **Prerequisites** steps to create a ZIM SDK instance of their own:


```javascript
var appID = xxxx; // Note: the appID is a set of numbers, not a String. 
// The [create] method creates a ZIM instance only on the first call. Any subsequent calls return null.
ZIM.create({ appID });
// Get the instance via [getInstance] to avoid hot updates that cause you to use the [create] method multiple times to create a singleton and return null.
var zim = ZIM.getInstance();
```   

### Set event callbacks

Before a client user's login, you will need to call the [on](@on) method to customize the event callbacks, such as you can receive callback notifications when SDK errors occur or receiving message related callback notifications.


```javascript
// Set up and listen for the callback for receiving error codes. 
zim.on('error', function (zim, errorInfo) {
    console.log('error', errorInfo.code, errorInfo.message);
});

// Set up and listen for the callback for connection status changes.
zim.on('connectionStateChanged', function (zim, { state, event, extendedData }) {
    console.log('connectionStateChanged', state, event, extendedData);
    // When SDK logout occurred due to a long-time network disconnection, you will need to log in again. 
    if (state == 0 && event == 3) {
        zim.login(userInfo, token)
    }
});

// Set up and listen for the callback for receiving one-to-one messages. 
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log('receivePeerMessage', messageList, fromConversationID);
});

// Set up and listen for the callback for token expires.
zim.on('tokenWillExpire', function (zim, { second }) {
    console.log('tokenWillExpire', second);
    // You can call the renewToken method to renew the token. 
    // To generate a new Token, refer to the Prerequisites.
    zim.renewToken(token)
        .then(function({ token }){
            // Renewed successfully.
        })
        .catch(function(err){
            // Renew failed.
        })
});
```



### Log in to the ZIM SDK

For client A and client B to send, receive messages, and renew the token after creating the ZIM SDK instance, they will need to log in to the ZIM SDK.

To log in, Clients A and B both need to do the following:
1. Call the [ZIMUserInfo](@-ZIMUserInfo)  method to create a user object.
2. Then, call the [login](@login) method with their own user information and the Token they get in the previous **Prerequisites** steps.

<Warning title="Warning">

- You can custom the **userID** and **userName**, and we recommend you set these two to a meaningful value and associate them with the account system of your application.
- If the token has expired, you will need to call the [renewToken](@renewToken) method in the [tokenWillExpire](@tokenWillExpire) method to renew the token before you try again.
</Warning>


```javascript
// To get the token for login, refer to the [Guides - Authentication] document. 
// userID must be within 32 bytes, and can only contain letters, numbers, and the following special characters: '~', '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')', '_', '+', '=', '-', '`', ';', '’', ',', '.', '<', '>', '/', '\'.
// userName must be within 256 bytes, no special characters limited.
var userInfo = { userID: 'xxxx', userName: 'xxxx' };
var token = '';

zim.login(userInfo, token)
    .then(function () {
        // Login successful.
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        // Login failed.
    });
```

### Send messages 

Client A can send messages to client B after logging in successfully.

</table>


To send one-to-one messages, for example, if client A wants to send a message to client B, then client A needs to call the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method with client B's userID, message content, and other info.
And client A can be notified whether the message is delivered successfully through the callback [ZIMMessageSentResult](@-ZIMMessageSentResult).

- [onMessageAttached](@onMessageAttached-ZIMMediaMessageSendNotification) callback: The callback on the message not sent yet. Before the message is sent, you can get a temporary [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage) message for you to implement your business logic as needed. For example, you can get the ID of the message before sending it. Or when sending a message with large content, such as a video, you can get the localMessageID of the message before the message is uploaded to implement a Loading UI effect.

```javascript
//  Send one-to-one text messages. 

var toConversationID = ''; // Peer user's ID.
var conversationType = 0; // Message type; 1-on- chat: 0, in-room chat: 1, group chat:2 
var config = { 
    priority: 1, // Set priority for the message. 1: Low (by default). 2: Medium. 3: High.
};

var messageTextObj = { type: 1, message: 'Message text', extendedData: 'Message extended info(optional)' };
var notification = {
    onMessageAttached: function(message) {
        // todo: Loading
    }
}

zim.sendMessage(messageTextObj, toConversationID, conversationType, config, notification)
    .then(function ({ message }) {
        // Message sent successfully.
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        // Failed to send a message.
    });
```


### Receive messages

After client B logs in, he will receive client A's message through the callback [on](@on) which is already set in the [receivePeerMessage](@receivePeerMessage) method. 


```javascript 
// Set up and listen for the callback for receiving the one-to-one messages. 
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log('receivePeerMessage', messageList, fromConversationID);
});
```

### Log out 

For a client to log out, call the [logout](@logout) method. 
```java
zim.logout();
```

### Destroy the ZIM SDK instance

To destroy the ZIM SDK instance, call the [destroy](@destroy) method.

```java
zim.destroy();
```
