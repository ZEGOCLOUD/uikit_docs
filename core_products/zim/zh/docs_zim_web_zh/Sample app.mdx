## Prepare the environment

- Install a browser on your computer or smartphone.
- Connect your device to the Internet.
- Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">node.js</a>, preferably version 14.18.1 or above.
- For browser versions and compatibility, please refer to [compatibility](./Introduction/Overview.mdx#compatibility).

## Prerequisites

You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/account/login) and obtained the AppID and ServerSecret required for accessing the In-app Chat service. The service is not enabled by default, so please first enable the service on the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/account/login) before using it (for more details, please refer to [Project Management - How to activate the In-app Chat Service](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/admin-console/activate-inapp-chat?platform=all&language=all)). If you are unable to enable the service, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for assistance.

        appID: 0, // Contact the ZEGOCLOUD techinical support to get the AppID. 
        serverSecret: '', // ontact the ZEGOCLOUD techinical support to get the ServerSecret.
    };
    ```

2. Run the following command in sequence to start the project by referring to the `README.md` file.

    ```bash
    npm install # Install dependencies required.
    npm run dev # Run the sample project after installing dependencies.
    ```
