# Send & Receive messages

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides the capability of message management, allowing you to send and receive one-to-one, group, in-room messages, query message history, delete messages, and more. With the message management feature, you can meet different requirements of various scenarios such as social entertainment, online shopping, online education, interactive live streaming, and more. 

This document describes how to send and receive messages with the ZIM SDK.

## Send/Receive regular messages

Regular messages refer to the messages of the following message types: ZIMTextMessage, ZIMCommandMessage, and ZIMBarrageMessage.

<Warning title="Warning">

- To receive event callbacks (receive in-room messages, get the connection status, token expiration, etc.), you can set up the [on](@on) method and listen for related callbacks. 
- When receiving messages, you need to determine the message is a Text message ([ZIMTextMessage](@-ZIMTextMessage)) or a Command message ([ZIMCommandMessage](@-ZIMCommandMessage)) because these two message types are based on the basic message class ([ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage)). You need to convert the basic message class to a concrete message type and then retrieve the message content from the `message` field.
- When a message is received, it can be sorted using the message's `orderKey`. The larger the `orderKey`, the newer the message. And the number of unread messages will be updated automatically upon receiving.
</Warning>

### Send messages

Take client A sending a message to client B as an example:


<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/in_app_chat/14538.png" /></Frame>

1. Client A and Client B create their own ZIM SDK instances, and set up an event handler [on](@on) to listen for the [receivePeerMessage](@receivePeerMessage) callback.
2. Client A and Client B log in to the ZIM SDK.
3. Client A calls the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method and set the `converversationType` to `ZIMConversationTypePeer` to send a one-to-one message to Client B. 
4. Client B listens for the [receivePeerMessage](@receivePeerMessage) method to receive Client A's one-to-one messages.

<Warning title="Warning">

You can't send messages to yourself by calling the `sendMessage` method (when toConversationID = your ID). If you did so, the error code 6000001 will return. 

</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript SampleCode
// Send one-on-one `Text` message. 

var toConversationID = ''; // Peer user's ID. 
var conversationType = 0; // Conversation type, 1-on-1 chat: 0. In-room chat: 1. Group chat: 2. 
var config = { 
    priority: 1, // Set message priority. Low: 1 (by default). Medium: 2. High: 3. 
};

var messageTextObj = { type: 1, message: 'Message content', extendedData: 'Extension info of the message (optional)' };
var notification = {
    onMessageAttached: function(message) {
        // todo: Loading
    }
}

zim.sendMessage(messageTextObj, toConversationID, conversationType, config, notification)
    .then(function ({ message }) {
        // c
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        // Failed to send message.
    });
```

</CodeGroup>

### Receive messages

<Note title="Note">

- To send messages, call the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method and set the `conversationType` accordingly.
- To receive messages:
    - One-on-one messages (Peer type), through the callback[receivePeerMessage](@receivePeerMessage).
    - In-room messages (Room type), through the callback [receiveRoomMessage](@receiveRoomMessage).
    - Group messages (Group type), through the callback [receiveGroupMessage](@receiveGroupMessage).
</Note>


<CodeGroup>
```javascript
// Callback for receiving the one-to-one message.
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log(messageList, fromConversationID);
});

// Callback for receiving the group message.
zim.on('receiveGroupMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log(messageList, fromConversationID);
});

// Callback for receiving the in-room message.
zim.on('receiveRoomMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log(messageList, fromConversationID);
});
```

</CodeGroup>


## Send/Receive rich media content


The ZIM SDK now supports sending and receiving messages of different rich media types, such as images, audio, video, and files. To send and receive rich media content, refer to the following:

1. To send rich media content after login, you will need to specify the message type (image, file, audio, video) first and then the session type (one-on-one chat, room chat, group chat).
2. For a receiver to receive and download the rich media content, set up and listen for related event callbacks based on the session type (one-on-one chat, room chat, group chat) after logging in.


### Send rich media content

To send rich media content after login, call the [sendMediaMessage](@sendMediaMessage) method, and specify the message type (image, file, audio, video), the session type (one-on-one chat, room chat, group chat), and message related configurations as needed.

<Warning title="Warning">

- When sending rich media content, the file path to be sent must be in `UTF-8` encoding format.
- To send rich media content to a room/group, the sender must be in the room/group.
</Warning>

        });
}
```
</details>

#### Callback for the sending progress of rich media content

To be notified of the sending progress of rich media content, you can set up and listen for the following callback.


Among which:

- message: The content of the message being sent.
- currentFileSize: The size of the message that has been sent.
- totalFileSize: The overall size of the message sent.


### Receive rich media content

To receive the rich media content messages, do the following:
1. Listen for the following callbacks based on the session type (one-on-one chat, room chat, group chat): [receivePeerMessage](@receivePeerMessage), [receiveRoomMessage](@receiveRoomMessage), [receiveGroupMessage](@receiveGroupMessage).
2. You will then directly get the URL property of the rich media message through the callback you listened for and receive the rich media message.


## Send/Receive signaling messages

The ZIM SDK allows you to implement signaling message sending and receiving. You can call the [ZIMCommandMessage](@-ZIMCommandMessage) operation to define the message type, for example, location message.

<Note title="Note">

This message type does not support offline push and local storage.
</Note>


Below is the sample code for **sending a signaling message to a specified user**.

### Send a signaling message 


<CodeGroup>
```javascript SampleCode
//  The user receives the signaling message.

var toConversationID = ''; // Peer user's ID. 
var conversationType = 0; // Conversation type, 1-on-1 chat: 0. In-room chat: 1. Group chat: 2. 
var config = { 
    priority: 1, // Set the message priority. Low: 1 (by default). Medium: 2. High: 3. 
};

// Here, the Uint8Array message content is converted into JSON string when the `Command` message is received.
// receivePeerMessage converts the Uint8Array to a JSON string when receiving a Command message of type 2.
var jsonText = JSON.stringify({ id: '111', name: 'Tom' });
var uint8Array =  new Uint8Array(Array.from(unescape(encodeURIComponent(jsonText))).map((val) => val.charCodeAt(0)));

var messageCommandObj = { type: 2, message: uint8Array };
var notification = {
    onMessageAttached: function(message) {
        // todo: Loading
    }
}
zim.sendMessage(messageCommandObj, toConversationID, conversationType, config, notification)
    .then(function ({ message }) {
        // Message sent successfully. 
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        // Failed to send message.
    });
```

</CodeGroup>


### Receive the signaling message 



<CodeGroup>
```javascript SampleCode
//  Receive custom messages.
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log(messageList, fromConversationID);
    messageList.forEach(function (msg) {
        // Here, take the JSON string as an example, which needs to be converted to Uint8Array.
        if (msg.type == 2) {
            var uint8Array = msg.message;
            var jsonText = decodeURIComponent(escape(String.fromCharCode(...Array.from(uint8Array))));
            var jsonObj = JSON.parse(jsonText);
            console.log('receivePeerMessage', jsonObj);
        }
    })
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Send/Receive custom messages 
	 
The ZIM SDK allows you to implement custom message sending and receiving. You can call the [ZIMCustomMessage](@-ZIMCustomMessage) operation to define the custom message type, for example, the voting message, solitaire message, or video card message. Below is the procedure. 

<Note title="Note">

- Only the ZIM SDK 2.8.0 or later supports sending, receiving, and viewing custom messages. 
- If the version of the receiving ZIM SDK is 2.0.0 or later but earlier than 2.8.0, the ZIM SDK can receive custom messages but will identify the message type as unknown. In addition, it cannot obtain the message content. To obtain the message content, upgrade the ZIM SDK to 2.8.0 or later. 
- If the version of the receiving ZIM SDK is 1.x.x, the ZIM SDK cannot receive custom messages and identify the message type as unknown. 
</Note>

### Send a custom message 

Call the same operation for sending ordinary messages, that is, [sendMessage](@sendMessage), to send custom messages. For more information about this operation, see [Send/Receive regular messages - Send messages](#send-rich-media-content). 

You need to call the [ZIMCustomMessage](@-ZIMCustomMessage) operation to define the custom message type, 

Below is the sample code for sending a custom message in a one-to-one chat: 

```javascript 

// Send a custom message. 
// Specify the user ID. 
var toConversationID = "xxxx"; 
var message = ""; // The text message of the custom message. 
var subType = 100; // The subtype of the custom message. 
var searchedContent = "";// The searched content of the custom message. 

var zimCustomMessage = { 
type: 200, 
message: message, 
subType: subType, 
searchedContent: searchedContent 
}; 

// The advanced attribute for message sending. 
var conversationType = 0; // The conversation type. Valid values: 0: one-to-one chat; 1: chat room; 2: group chat. 
var config = { 
priority: 1, // Specify the message priority. Valid values: 1 (default): low; 2: medium; 3: high. 
}; 

zim.sendMessage(zimCustomMessage, toConversationID, conversationType, config).then(function ({ message }) { 
// Sending succeeded. 
}) 
.catch(function (err) { 
// Sending failed. 
}); 
``` 

### Receive custom messages 

Call the same operation for receiving ordinary messages to receive custom messages. For more information about this operation, see [Send/Receive regular messages - Receive messages](#receive-rich-media-content). 

Below is the sample code for receiving a custom message in a one-to-one chat: 

```javascript 
// The user receives the custom message in the one-to-one chat. 
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) { 
console.log(messageList, fromConversationID); 
messageList.forEach(function (msg) { 
// The `Custom` message is received. 
if (msg.type == 200) { 
} 
}) 
}); 
``` 

## Send and receive mentioned messages 

A mentioned message contains the @ symbol and the mentioned user who will be notified of the message. 

<Note title="Note">

A mentioned message is not a message type. A text message can also be a mentioned message. 
</Note>

### Send a mentioned message 

When calling the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) operation to send a message, you can specify the [MentionedUserIDs](@MentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage) parameter of [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage) to set the message to a mentioned message: 
- [mentionedUserIDs](@mentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage): It notifies the mentioned user (who can be out of the conversation) of the message. The parameter can contain up to 50 bytes in length. If you need a longer length, contact ZEGO technical support. 
- [isMentionAll](@isMentionAll-ZIMMessage): It notifies all other users in a conversation of the message. 

<Note title="Note">

Only the ZIM SDK 2.14.0 or later supports sending mentioned messages. 
</Note>

```javascript 
// Below is the sample code for sending a mentioned message (text message) in a one-to-one chat: 
var toConversationID = ''; // The ID of the other user. 
var conversationType = 0; // The conversation type. Valid values: 0: one-to-one chat; 1: chat room; 2: group chat. 
var config = { 
priority: 1, // Specify the message priority. Valid values: 1 (default): low; 2: medium; 3: high. 
}; 

var messageTextObj = { type: 1, message: 'Text message content', extendedData: 'Optional: extended information of the message' }; 

// Call the operation to notify users in the list of the message. 
message.mentionedUserIDs = ["userId1", "userId2"]; 

// Notify all other users in the conversation of the message. 
message.isMentionAll = true; 

var notification = { 
onMessageAttached: function(message) { 
// todo: Loading 
} 
} 

zim.sendMessage(messageTextObj, toConversationID, conversationType, config, notification) 
.then(function ({ message }) { 
// Sending succeeded. 
}) 
.catch(function (err) { 
// Sending failed. 
}); 


``` 

### Receive a mentioned message 

Call the same operation for receiving ordinary messages to receive mentioned messages. For more information about this operation, see [Send and receive ordinary messages - Receive messages](#receive-rich-media-content). 

After messages are received, you can implement features, for example, highlighting, based on the business logic. 

<Note title="Note">

- Only the ZIM SDK 2.14.0 or later supports receiving and viewing mentioned messages. 
- If the version of the receiving ZIM SDK is 2.0.0 or later but earlier than 2.14.0, the received message does not contain the mentioned content. 
- If the version of the receiving ZIM SDK is 1.x.x, mentioned messages cannot be received. 
</Note>

### Obtain the mentionedInfoList 

After a user in a conversation is notified, the [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation) can be obtained manually or automatically. 

[mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation): It contains the mentioned message ID, sender ID, and the mentioned message type. [ZIMMessageMentionedType](@-ZIMMessageMentionedType): You can specify this parameter to implement various business logics, for example, mentioning. 

#### Automatic obtaining 

If a user is notified, the [conversationChanged](@conversationChanged) callback is received, which can be used to obtain the latest [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation) of the [ZIMConversation](@-ZIMConversation). 

```javascript 
zim.on('conversationChanged', function (zim, { info }) { 
565	+ console.log(info); 
}); 
``` 

#### Manual obtaining 

If the [queryConversationList](@queryConversationList) or [queryConversation](@queryConversation) operation is called to pull a conversation, the [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList-ZIMConversation) in the conversation is also obtained. Below is the sample code: 

```javascript 
var mentionedInfoList = conversaion.mentionedInfoList; 
``` 

### Clear the mentionedInfoList of a conversation 

After a mentioned message is received, the mentioned user needs to clear the [mentionedInfoList](@mentionedInfoList) to get rid of the notification. 

The operation for clearing the mentionedInfoList of a conversation is the same as that for clearing the number of unread messages of a conversation. 
- [clearConversationUnreadMessageCount](@clearConversationUnreadMessageCount): It clears the number of unread messages of a conversation. For more information, see [Conversation management - Clear the number of unread messages in a conversation](./../Conversation/Get%20the%20conversation%20list.mdx). 
- [clearConversationTotalUnreadMessageCount](@clearConversationTotalUnreadMessageCount): It clears the number of unread messages of all conversations. For more information, see [Conversation management - Clear the numbers of unread messages in all conversations](./../Conversation/Get%20the%20conversation%20list.mdx). 

### Obtain the list of mentioned users 

All users in a conversation can obtain the list of mentioned users with the [MentionedUserIDs](@MentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage) parameter of the [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage), that is, the list of users passed in with the [MentionedUserIDs](@MentionedUserIDs-ZIMMessage) parameter of the [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage) by the sender. 

```javascript 
var userIds = message.mentionedUserIDs; 
``` 

### Check whether to mention all. 

All users in a conversation can call the [isMentionAll](@isMentionAll) operation to check whether a message mentions all. 

```javascript 
var isMentionAll = message.isMentionAll; 
``` 

## Send and receive a message that mentions all 

The ZIM SDK allows you to send a message to all online users from the server and allows these users to receive the message from the client. 

### Send a message to all users from the server 

For more information about how to send a message to all users from the server, see [Push Message To All Users](!zim-PushMessageToAllUsers). 

### Receive a message that mentions all from the server 

<Note title="Note">

- Only the ZIM SDK 2.10.0 or later supports receiving and viewing a message that mentions all. 
- If the version of the receiving ZIM SDK is 2.0.0 or later but earlier than 2.10.0, the ZIM SDK cannot receive the message that mentions all from the server. To receive the message, upgrade the ZIM SDK to 2.10.0 or later. 
</Note>

To receive a message that mentions all, call the [broadcastMessageReceived](@broadcastMessageReceived) operation. 

Sample code: 
```javascript 
// Users receive the message that mentions all. 
zim.on('broadcastMessageReceived', function (zim, { message }) { 
console.log(message); 
}); 
``` 

## Forward message

The ZIM SDK supports forwarding messages in one of the following ways: 

- Combining messages and forwarding the combined message. 
- Forwarding messages one by one.

For more information, see [Forward messages](./Forward%20messages.mdx).

## Receive Tips message


ZIM SDK supports converting user operations within a session into Tips messages. When a related operation occurs, ZIM SDK will send a Tips message to the session to notify. For details, please refer to [Receive tip messages](./Receive%20tip%20messages.mdx).


## Listen for the message status 


On a weak network condition, this may happen: the ZIM SDK doesn't receive the response from the server for some reason (e.g., packet loss), while the message is successfully sent. In this case, the ZIM SDK considers the message sending failed due to the reply timeout, but the message is actually sent successfully, which results in message status confusion.
To solve this and Clarify the message status, the SDK 2.6.0 or later now allows you to listen for the [messageSentStatusChanged](@messageSentStatusChanged) callback to receive the changes of the message status.
And we now have three different message statuses: Sending = 0, Success = 1, and Failed = 2.
You can know whether your message is sent successfully by the status, and implement your event handling logic as needed.

```javascript
// Listen for the message status.
zim.on('messageSentStatusChanged', function (zim, result) {
    result.infos.forEach( function (info) {
        console.warn(info.message, info.status);
    });  
});
```
