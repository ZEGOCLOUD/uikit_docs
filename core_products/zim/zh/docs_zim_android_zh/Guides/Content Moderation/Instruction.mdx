## Operation

After completing the service activation mentioned above, you can directly use the built-in content moderation service of ZIM.

When a user sends a message, ZIM will review the message based on the moderation policies, thresholds, and strengths set for the corresponding message channel (one-on-one chat, group chat, room), and perform relevant business operations based on the moderation result.

If a message fails to be sent due to moderation, you will receive error code 6000221. You can perform relevant business operations based on this error code.

If you need to adjust the moderation policies, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support. The keys for configuring moderation policies are as follows:
- **Custom moderation policies for different message sources**: Now, ZIM supports setting different moderation policies for different message channels. For example, if you use ZIM in one-on-one chat and group chat scenarios, you can set different moderation thresholds for the "one-on-one chat" and "group chat" to meet your needs. For more details, please refer to [Overview - Built-in content moderation capability](./Overview.mdx).
- **Moderation level affects how ZIM handles messages based on moderation results**: The moderation results include: "**pass**", "**uncertain**", or "**fail**".
    - If you set the moderation level to **Weak Moderation**: ZIM will continue sending the message when the moderation result is "uncertain".
    - If you set the moderation level to **Strong Moderation**: ZIM will stop sending the message when the moderation result is "uncertain". You can set the corresponding moderation level based on your business needs.
- **Choose whether to send before moderation, or moderate before sending**: When sending image messages in one-on-one chats and group chats, you can choose "send before moderation" or "moderate before sending" based on your needs to maximize the responsiveness of messages in your business. Similar restrictions include:
    - Text messages only support "moderate before sending*".
    - Due to the fact that ZIM does not store messages in rooms, in order to maximize the security and compliance of messages, text and image messages in rooms only support "moderate before sending".
    - For audio and video messages, due to their large file sizes and special usage scenarios, there is a longer moderation delay. ZIM defaults to "moderate before sending" for these types of messages.
