# ZIM error codes


<Warning title="Warning">
The newly released **In-app Chat 2.0.0** has been upgraded considerably (for detailed changes, see [Release notes](./../Client%20SDKs/Release%20notes.mdx)). If the version of the SDK you are using is **earlier than 2.0.0**, for its error codes, see [Error codes for In-app Chat 1.x.x](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/14297).
For a better development experience, we recommend you use the latest version of SDK.
</Warning>

## Overview

This document provides possible causes and solutions for the network errors or the errors that you may encounter when running **the latest version of SDK**.


:::if{props.platform=undefined}
If the `errorCode` field exists in the result after the method is called, which indicates that an error occurs. And the code will be like this: 
```java
zim.setEventHandler(new ZIMEventHandler() {
    @Override

    Log.e(TAG, "errorCode:" + error);
             
});
```
:::

    NSLog(@"errorCode%lu,%@",(unsigned long)errorInfo.code,errorInfo.message);
}
```
:::
:::if{props.platform="Flutter"}
If the `errorCode` field exists in the result after the method is called, which indicates that an error occurs. And the code will be like this:
