# Modify a notification badge


## Overview

ZPNs supports offline push notification receiver app to update the app icon badge with the number of unread messages, reminding users of the unread message count.

## Prerequisites

- ZPNs SDK version 2.6.0 or above has been integrated and the function of offline push notification has been implemented. For details, please refer to this document [Implement offline push notification](./../Implement%20offline%20push%20notification.mdx).
- Android device or emulator with Android 9.0 or above version (real device is recommended).

## Send offline push notifications with badge information

When sending messages or call invitations, the sender can modify the badge-related parameters in [ZIMPushConfig](@-ZIMPushConfig) to determine the changes in the badge on the receiving end.

```java
ZIMPushConfig pushConfig = new ZIMPushConfig();
// Whether the push notification carries badge information, default is false.
pushConfig.enableBadge = true;
// The badge increment for the target of this push notification. Set it as 1 here, which will increase the badge number of the receiving end app by 1.
pushConfig.badgeIncrement = 1;
```

## Update the badge automatically

Starting from [Android 8.0 (API level 26)](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/badges), the system will display a badge (a dot) by default after receiving a push notification from FCM.

After clearing the notification in the notification bar, the badge will also be automatically cleared.
