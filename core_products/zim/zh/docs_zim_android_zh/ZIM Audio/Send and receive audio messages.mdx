# Send and receive audio messages


This topic describes how to use the ZIM SDK and ZIM Audio SDK to send and receive audio messages.

<Warning title="Warning">
Before using this feature, please make sure you have [logged in to ZIM](./../Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx).
</Warning>

## Usage steps

The whole process mainly includes audio recording, sending, receiving, and playback. In this example, an audio message is sent from client A to client B:

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/in_app_chat/17472.png" /></Frame>

### 1. Import the header file
Import the `ZIMAudio.h` header file to your project.
```java
import im.zego.zim_audio.ZIMAudio;
```

### 2. Initialize the ZIM Audio SDK


Call the [init](@init) method to initialize the ZIM Audio SDK before calling other methods of this SDK.

To only implement audio message sending and receiving, you can pass in an empty string for the parameter in this method.

To implement more features, pass in a license. For more information about how to obtain a license, see [Implement online authentication](./Implement%20online%20authentication.mdx).


```java
// Initialize the ZIM Audio SDK.
// In this scenario, no license is required.
String license = "";
ZIMAudio.getInstance().init(application, license);
```

### 3. Listen for the callback

1. Create a subclass that inherits the [ZIMAudioEventHandler](@-ZIMAudioEventHandler) abstract class and override the methods in it.
   
   ```java
    import im.zego.zim_audio.callback.ZIMAudioEventHandler;
    import im.zego.zim_audio.entity.ZIMAudioError;

    public class ZIMAudioEventHandler extends ZIMAudioEventHandler {
        
        @Override
        public void onError(ZIMAudioError errorInfo) {
            super.onError(errorInfo);
            
        }
    }
    @end
    ```

2. Call the [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler-ZIMAudio) class to listen for one of its instances.
   
    ```java
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().setEventHandler(ZIMAudioEventHandlerImpl.getInstance());
    ```

### 4. Record an audio file

#### 4.1 Start the recording

1. Call the [startRecord](@startRecord) method on the sending client to define the audio duration and the local absolute path to store the audio file, which must contain the filename and extension, for example, `xxx/xxx/xxx.m4a`. Only M4A and MP3 files are supported.
   
    ```java

    ZIMAudioRecordConfig config = new ZIMAudioRecordConfig();
    config.maxDuration = 10 * 1000; // The maximum duration (ms) of the recorded audio.
                                    // The default duration is 60,000 ms, that is, 60 seconds. The maximum duration is 120,000 ms, that is, 120 seconds.
                                    // In this example, the duration is 10 x 1,000 ms, that is, 10 seconds.
    config.filePath = ""; //  The local absolute path to store the audio file, with the extension, for example, `xxx/xxx/xxx.m4a`. Only M4A and MP3 files are supported.

    ZIMAudio.getInstance().startRecord(config);
    ```


2. Trigger the callback.
   
   - After the recording starts, listen for the [onRecorderStarted](@onRecorderStarted) callback on the sending client to update the UI.
     
        ```java
        public void onRecorderStarted() {}
        ```

   - The ZIM Audio SDK updates the recording progress once every 500 ms in the [onRecorderProgress](@onRecorderProgress) callback, indicating the duration of the recorded audio file, which can be used to update the UI.
     
        ```java
        public void onRecorderProgress(int currentDuration) {}
        ```
   
   - If the recording fails due to an error, the ZIM Audio SDK sends a notification in the [onRecorderFailed](@onRecorderFailed) callback, and you can handle the failure based on this callback and the error codes specified in [ZIM Audio SDK error codes](./../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM%20Audio.mdx).
     
        ```java
        public void onRecorderFailed(ZIMAudioErrorCode errorCode) {}
        ```


#### 4.2 Complete the recording

1. To complete the recording, call the [completeRecord](@completeRecord) method.
   
    
   
   <Note title="Note">
   - Make sure that you have received the [onRecorderStarted](@onRecorderStarted) callback before calling the [completeRecord](@completeRecord) method; otherwise, the recording is canceled, and an error is reported, indicating that the duration is too short.
   - If the recording is not completed or canceled, the ZIM Audio SDK automatically completes it when the duration reaches the maximum and triggers the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback.
   </Note>



    
  ```java
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().completeRecord();
   ```

2. After receiving the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback, you can find the specified absolute audio file path.

    ```java
    public void onRecorderCompleted(int totalDuration) {}  // `totalDuration` indicates the total duration (ms) of the audio file.
   ```


#### 4.3 (Optional) Cancel the recording

1. To cancel the recording and delete the recorded audio, call the [cancelRecord](@cancelRecord) method.
   
    ```java
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().cancelRecord();
    ```

2. Calling the [cancelRecord](@cancelRecord) method triggers the [onRecorderCancelled](@onRecorderCancelled) callback to the sending client, which uses the callback to update the UI.
   
    ```java
    public void onRecorderCancelled() {}
    ```

#### 4.4 (Optional) Check whether the recording is in progress

To obtain the recording status, call the [isRecording](@isRecording) method.

```java
boolean isRecording = ZIMAudio.getInstance().isRecording();
```

### 5. Send the audio message


After the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback is triggered, build the [ZIMAudioMessage](@-ZIMAudioMessage) object (ZIM audio message) by using the specified absolute path and call the [sendMediaMessage](@sendMediaMessage) method to send the message. Below is the sample code for sending an audio message in a one-to-one chat.


```java
ZIMAudio.getInstance().setEventHandler(new ZIMAudioEventHandler() {
    // The callback for recording completion.
    @Override
    public void onRecorderCompleted(int totalDuration) {
        super.onRecorderCompleted(totalDuration);
        // Convert audio duration in milliseconds to ZIM seconds
        int second = totalDuration / 1000;
        // Create the audio message.
        ZIMAudioMessage message = new ZIMAudioMessage("Recording audio file path", second);
        ZIMMessageSendConfig config = new ZIMMessageSendConfig();
        // Send the audio message in a one-to-one chat.
        ZIM.getInstance().sendMediaMessage(message, "One-to-one chat ID", ZIMConversationType.PEER, config, new ZIMMediaMessageSentCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onMessageSent(ZIMMessage message, ZIMError errorInfo) {
                    if(errorInfo.code == ZIMErrorCode.SUCCESS){
                        //The message is sent successfully.
                    }else{
                        //Handle the error based on the corresponding error code table.
                    }
            }
            @Override
            public void onMessageAttached(ZIMMediaMessage message){
            }
            @Override
            public void onMediaUploadingProgress(String fileUID, long currentFileSize, long totalFileSize, ZIMMediaMessage message) {
            }
        });
    }
});
```

### 6. Receive the audio message


Based on the conversation type (one-to-one chat, voice chatroom, or group chat), listen for the [onReceivePeerMessage](@onReceivePeerMessage), [onReceiveGroupMessage](@onReceiveGroupMessage) and [onReceiveRoomMessage](@onReceiveRoomMessage)) callback on the receiving client to receive the audio message notification and then call the [downloadMediaFile](@downloadMediaFile) method to download the audio file to the local database.

Below is the sample code for receiving and downloading an audio message in a one-to-one chat.

```java
// The `onReceivePeerMessage` callback is triggered when a one-to-one message is received.
 @Override
    public void onReceivePeerMessage(ZIM zim, ArrayList<ZIMMessage> messageList, String fromUserID) {
        super.onReceivePeerMessage(zim, messageList, fromUserID);
        // Traverse the received message list
        for (ZIMMessage message : messageList) {
            // When receiving a message, you can determine the type of message received by its Type
            // If the message type is audio
            if (message.getType() == ZIMMessageType.AUDIO) {
                // Get the audio message
                ZIMAudioMessage audioMessage = (ZIMAudioMessage) message;
                zim.downloadMediaFile(imageMessage, ZIMMediaFileType.ORIGINAL_FILE, new ZIMMediaDownloadedCallback() {

                    @Override
                    public void onMediaDownloaded(ZIMMediaMessage message, ZIMError errorInfo) {
                        if(errorInfo.code == ZIMErrorCodeSuccess){
                             message.fileLocalPath; // Download successful, get the local absolute path of the audio file
                        }else{
                            // Download failed, handle the failure event according to the ZIM official error code table
                        }
                    }

                    @Override
                    // Get the download progress of the audio file here
                    public void onMediaDownloadingProgress(ZIMMediaMessage message, long currentFileSize, long totalFileSize) {
                        // Download progress callback
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }  
```

For more information about the download progress, see [Callback for the downloading progress of rich media content](./../Guides/Messaging/Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#receive-rich-media-content).

### 7. Play the audio file

#### 7.1 Start the playback

1. To play the audio file, call the [startPlay](@startPlay) method on the receiving client to pass in the local absolute path of the audio file and set the routing type for audio output.
   
    ```java
      // Play the audio.
      // Configure playback settings.
   ZIMAudioPlayConfig config = new ZIMAudioPlayConfig();
        /**
          * ZIMAudioRouteTypeSpeaker: speaker playback
          * ZIMAudioRouteTypeReceiver: receiver playback
          */
        config.routeType = ZIMAudioRouteTypeSpeaker;
        config.filePath = "";//Fill in the local path of the audio file.
        ZIMAudio.getInstance().startPlay(config);
        ```

2. Trigger the callback.
   
   - Listen for the [onPlayerStarted](@onPlayerStarted) callback to update the UI.
     
        ```java
        public void onPlayerStarted(int totalDuration) {} // `totalDuration` is the total duration (ms) of the audio file.
     ```
   
   - The ZIM Audio SDK updates the playback progress once every 500 ms in the [onPlayerProgress](@onPlayerProgress) callback, indicating the playback duration of the audio file, which can be used to update the UI.
     
        ```java
        public void onPlayerProgress(int currentDuration) {}
        ```
   
   - If the playback fails due to an error, the ZIM Audio SDK sends a notification in the [onPlayerFailed](@onPlayerFailed) callback, and you can handle the failure based on this callback and the error codes specified in [ZIM Audio SDK error codes](./../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM%20Audio.mdx).
     
        ```java
        public void onPlayerFailed(ZIMAudioErrorCode errorCode) {}
        ```

   - If the playback is interrupted by recording, an incoming call, or audio output device preemption, the ZIM Audio SDK sends the [onPlayerInterrupted](@onPlayerInterrupted) callback.
     
        ```java
        public void onPlayerInterrupted() {}
        ```
   
   - When the playback ends, the ZIM Audio SDK sends the [onPlayerEnded](@onPlayerEnded) callback.
     
        ```java
        public void onPlayerEnded() {}
        ```

3. (Optional) To switch the audio output device (loudspeaker or headphone) during playback, call the [setAudioRouteType](@setAudioRouteType) method.
   
    <Warning title="Warning">
   If the headphone is connected, this method does not take effect, and the audio is still output from the headphone.
    </Warning>
   
      ```java
    // Set the output device to the loudspeaker.
     ZIMAudio.getInstance().setAudioRouteType(ZIMAudioRouteType.SPEAKER);
     
    ```

#### 7.2 (Optional) Stop the playback

1. To stop the playback, call the [stopPlay](@stopPlay) method.
   
    ```java
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().stopPlay();
    ```

2. Listen for the [onPlayerStopped](@onPlayerStopped) callback to update the UI. After the playback is stopped or ends, the ZIM Audio SDK releases the audio device.
   
    ```java
    public void onPlayerStopped() {}
    ```

### 8. Deinitialize the ZIM Audio SDK

If the audio feature is no longer in use, call the [uninit](@uninit) method to release resources.

```java
ZIMAudio.getInstance().uninit();
```
