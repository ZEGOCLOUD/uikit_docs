<Card title="Sample Code" href="https://storage.zego.im/zim/example/unity/Unity3dDemo.zip" target="_blank">Click here to get the complete sample code.</Card>

Here we provide you with a sample application to experience ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat, and also describe how to run the sample code.

### Prerequisites

Go to [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) to create a new project, and get the AppID and AppSign of your project.

<Warning title="Warning">

The SDK now also supports using Token for authentication, if you want to change your authentication mode, refer to the [Guide for upgrading the authentication mode from using the AppSign to Token](https://docs.zegocloud.com/faq/token_upgrade). 
</Warning>

#### Environment-specific requirements:


- Install Unity 2021.3.18f1c1 or later version. If not installed, you can download Unity Hub from [Unity official website](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), and then install the Unity version you need (if you are not sure, it is recommended to install the latest LTS version). When downloading, it is recommended to select the corresponding Platforms module according to your needs, for example, installing on Windows:

- Select the corresponding development environment or device according to the platform that the sample code needs to run on:

    - To run the Android sample source code: requires devices or emulators that support Android 4.1 or later versions and JDK 1.6 or later versions (it is recommended to use a real device). If it is a real device, please enable the "allow debugging" option.
    - To run the iOS sample source code: requires Xcode 13.0 or later versions and devices or emulators that support iOS 9.0 or later versions (it is recommended to use a real device).
    - To run the macOS sample source code: requires macOS 10.11 or later versions.
    - To run the Windows sample source code: requires Windows 7 or later versions and Visual Studio 2015 or later versions installed.
    - Ensure that the device running the program is connected to the network properly.
    - Ensure that Unity has installed the Platforms module corresponding to the platform that needs to be run. If Unity has been installed but the corresponding Platforms module has not been installed, you need to download the corresponding module. For example, on Windows: Open Unity Hub, click the "Install" option on the left, select the Unity version to be installed, click the icon in the upper right corner, select the "Add modules" option, and select the corresponding module in the pop-up window for download.
