# Manage group members

- - -

<Note title="Note">

This document is applicable to the following platforms of Unity framework: iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.
</Note>


ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides the capability of group member management, allowing you to query the group member list and group member info, change the group owner, and more.


<Warning title="Warning">

- Before you use the following features, you must join a group first. To join a group, refer to the Chapter **Join a group** of [Manage groups](./Manage%20groups.mdx).
</Warning>



## Get group member list


To know who is in the current group and get the group member list after login, call the [QueryGroupMemberList](@QueryGroupMemberList) method. 

You will receive a notification through the callback [ZIMGroupMemberListQueriedCallback](@ZIMGroupMemberListQueriedCallback) after the query succeeds. 

#### Sample code

```c#
// Group members query the member list of a group
ZIMGroupMemberQueryConfig config = new ZIMGroupMemberQueryConfig();
config.count = 100;
config.nextFlag = 0;
ZIM.GetInstance().QueryGroupMemberList("group_id", config, (string groupID, List<ZIMGroupMemberInfo> userList,
    uint nextFlag, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Use errorInfo.code to get the result of querying the group member list     
    }
);
```


## Get group member info

To know the info of a specified member after joining a group, call the [QueryGroupMemberInfo](@QueryGroupMemberInfo) method.

You will receive the specific info throught the callback [ZIMGroupMemberInfoQueriedCallback](@ZIMGroupMemberInfoQueriedCallback) after the query succeeds.


#### Sample code

```c#
// Group members query the information of a specific member in a group
ZIM.GetInstance().QueryGroupMemberInfo("user_id", "group_id", (string groupID, ZIMGroupMemberInfo userInfo, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Use errorInfo.code to get the result of querying the group member information     
    }
);
```



## Set an alias


To set an alias after joining a group, call the [SetGroupMemberNickname](@SetGroupMemberNickname) method.

<Warning title="Warning">

The group owner can set the alias of all group members. But the group members can only set their own aliases.
</Warning>


You will receive a notification through the callback [ZIMGroupMemberNicknameUpdatedCallback](@ZIMGroupMemberNicknameUpdatedCallback) after the alias is set successfully. 


#### Sample code

```c#
// Group members set nickname. Note: The group owner can set the nickname for themselves and other members in the group; other group members can only set their own nickname in the group.
ZIM.GetInstance().SetGroupMemberNickname("member_new_nick_name", "user_id", "group_id", (string groupID, string forUserID,
    string nickname, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Use errorInfo.code to get the result of setting the nickname
    }
);
```

## Set a role for a group member


For a group owner to set a role for a group member, call the [SetGroupMemberRole](@SetGroupMemberRole) method. You can set the group member to a regular member or admin.

<Warning title="Warning">

Only the group owner can set roles for group members.
</Warning>


All group members will receive a notification through the callback [ZIMGroupMemberRoleUpdatedCallback](@ZIMGroupMemberRoleUpdatedCallback) after the role is set successfully.

#### Sample code

```c#
// Group owner sets the role of other group members
int role = ZIMGroupMemberRole.ZIMGroupMemberRoleOwner;
ZIM.GetInstance().SetGroupMemberRole(role, "user_id", "group_id", (string groupID, string forUserID,
    int role, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Use errorInfo.code to get the result of setting the role of the group member
    }
);
```


## Transfer the group ownership


For a group owner to transfer the group ownership, call the [TransferGroupOwner](@TransferGroupOwner) method with the `toUserID` (the ID of the member you want to transfer the group ownership to).

<Warning title="Warning">

- Only the group owner has permission to change the group owner.
- The member you want to transfer the group ownership to must be in the group; otherwise, the operation fails.
</Warning>

All group members will receive a notification through the callback [ZIMGroupOwnerTransferredCallback](@ZIMGroupOwnerTransferredCallback) after the group owner is changed. 


#### Sample code

```c#
// Transfer the group owner identity to another group member

ZIM.GetInstance().TransferGroupOwner("new_group_owner_id", "group_id", (string groupID, string toUserID, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Use errorInfo.code to get the result of transferring the group owner identity
    }
);
```

## Query the number of group members


To query the number of group members after logging in and joining a group, call the [QueryGroupMemberCount](@QueryGroupMemberCount) method.

You will receive the query results through the callback [ZIMGroupMemberCountQueriedCallback](@ZIMGroupMemberCountQueriedCallback).


#### Sample code

```c#
// Group members query the number of members in the group
ZIM.GetInstance().QueryGroupMemberCount("GROUP_ID", (string groupID, uint count, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Get the number of group members
    }
);
```
