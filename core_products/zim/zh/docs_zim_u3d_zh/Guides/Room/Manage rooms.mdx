# Manage rooms

<Note title="Note">

This document is applicable to the following platforms of Unity framework: iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.
</Note>

## Overview

ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides the capability of room messaging, allows multiple users to send text or custom messages to a room, and chat and share ideas in real time.

With the room messaging feature, you can build your app to meet different requirements of various scenarios, such as one-to-many classes, online conferences, and more. 



## Join a room 

Now, we provide two methods to join a room:

- <b>[Method 1: Manually create a room & Join a room ](#method-1-manually-create-a-room--join-a-room-)</b>: Call the [CreateRoom](@CreateRoom) method with the [ZIMRoomInfo](@-ZIMRoomInfo) info to manually create a room first. And other client users call the [JoinRoom](@JoinRoom) with the roomID to join the room.


- <b>[Method 2: Join a room directly (room will be created automatically)](#method-2-join-a-room-directly-room-will-be-created-automatically)</b>: Call the [EnterRoom](@EnterRoom) method with [ZIMRoomInfo](@-ZIMRoomInfo) info to join a room directly (if the room doesn't exist, the room will be created automatically). Other client users can call the [EnterRoom](@EnterRoom) method with the roomID to join the room.

For in-room users to send messages to a room, call the [SendMessage](@SendMessage) method. For details, see [Send & Receive messages](./../Messaging/Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#sendreceive-custom-messages).


<Note title="Note">

If the room (roomID) already exists:

- Call the [CreateRoom](@CreateRoom) method: returns an error code. For details, see [Error codes](./../../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM.mdx#room-errors).
- Call the [EnterRoom](@EnterRoom) method: you will join the room directly. 

If the room (roomID) doesn't exist:

- Call the [CreateRoom](@CreateRoom) method: you can create a room, and you will join the room upon creation. 
- Call the [EnterRoom](@EnterRoom) method: a room will be created automatically, and you will join the room directly. 
</Note>


### Method 1: Manually create a room & Join a room 

#### Manually create a room

Let's suppose we have Client A and Client B. The following shows how Client A creates a room, how Client B and other client users join the room. 

For Client A to create a room after login, he can call the [CreateRoom](@CreateRoom) method with the [ZIMRoomInfo](@-ZIMRoomInfo) info. And he can be told whether the room is created successfully by the `ZIMError` parameter. For related error codes, see [Error codes](./../../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM.mdx).



<Warning title="Warning">

- You can customize the **roomID** and **roomName**, and we recommend you set the **roomID** to a meaningful value and associate them with the account system of your application.
- After creating a room by calling the [CreateRoom](@CreateRoom) method, you will directly join the room you just created, you don't need to call the [JoinRoom](@JoinRoom) method to join the room.
</Warning>


```c#
// The roomID is a string with a maximum length of 32 bytes and can only contain numbers, English characters, and these special characters: '!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '+', '-', ':', ';', '<', '=', '.', '>', '?', '[', ']', '^', '_', '{', '}', '|', '~'.
// The roomName is a string with a maximum length of 64 bytes and has no special character restrictions.
ZIMRoomInfo zimRoomInfo = new ZIMRoomInfo();
zimRoomInfo.roomID = "roomID";
zimRoomInfo.roomName = "roomName";
ZIM.GetInstance().CreateRoom(zimRoomInfo, (ZIMRoomFullInfo zimRoomFullInfo, ZIMError error) =>
{
    if (error.code == ZIMErrorCode.Success)
    {
        // Created successfully.          
    }
    else
    {
        // Failed to create.            
    }
});
```

#### Join a room 

For Client B and other client users to join the room created by Client A, call the [JoinRoom](@JoinRoom) method with the roomID of client A's room. And Client B and other client users can be told whether they joined the room successfully by the `ZIMError` parameter. For related error codes, see [Error codes](./../../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM.mdx).


```C#
ZIM.GetInstance().JoinRoom("roomID", (ZIMRoomFullInfo zimRoomFullInfo, ZIMError error) =>
{
    if (error.code == ZIMErrorCode.Success)
    {
        //Joined successfully.
    }
    else
    {
        // Failed to join.
    }
});
```

To receive notifications when a new room member joins the room, set up and listen for the callback [OnRoomMemberJoined](@OnRoomMemberJoined). 

The following shows Client A receives the callback notification when Client B joins the room created by Client A:


```c#
ZIM.GetInstance().onRoomMemberJoined = (ZIM zim, List<ZIMUserInfo> memberList,
                                            string roomID) =>
{
    // Info of the member who join the room.
};
```


### Method 2: Join a room directly (room will be created automatically)

Let's suppose we have Client A and Client B. The following shows how Client A joins the room without creating a room manually, and how Client B and other client users join the room.

1. After logs in, Client A calls the [EnterRoom](@EnterRoom) method with the [ZIMRoomInfo](@-ZIMRoomInfo) information. The room will be created automatically when the passed roomID doesn't exist.

2. Client B and other client users call the [EnterRoom](@EnterRoom) method with the roomID to join the room created by Client A. 

3. For in-room client users to receive notifications when a new room member joins the room, set up and listen for the callback [OnRoomMemberJoined](@OnRoomMemberJoined).



```C#
ZIMRoomInfo zimRoomInfo = new ZIMRoomInfo();
zimRoomInfo.roomID = "roomID";
zimRoomInfo.roomName = "roomName";

ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig config = new ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig();

ZIM.GetInstance().EnterRoom(zimRoomInfo, config, (ZIMRoomFullInfo zimRoomFullInfo, ZIMError error) =>
{
    if (error.code == ZIMErrorCode.Success)
    {
        // Entered successfully.           
    }
    else
    {
        // Failed to enter.           
    }
});
```

```c#
// Listen for the callback. 
ZIM.GetInstance().onRoomMemberJoined = (ZIM zim, List<ZIMUserInfo> memberList,
                                                    string roomID) =>
{
    // Info of the member who join the room.
};
```


## Leave a room 


For Client B to leave the room, call the [LeaveRoom](@LeaveRoom) method with `roomID`.
And Client A and other client users in the room will receive notifications through the callback [OnRoomMemberLeft](@OnRoomMemberLeft) method. 

Room members who leave the room cannot receive messages in the room anymore.



```c#
// Leave the room.
ZIM.GetInstance().LeaveRoom("roomID", (string roomID, ZIMError errorInfo) =>
{
    if (errorInfo.code == ZIMErrorCode.Success)
    {
        // Left successfully.
    }
    else
    {
        // Failed to leave.
    }
});
```

```c#
ZIM.GetInstance().onRoomMemberLeft = (ZIM zim, List<ZIMUserInfo> memberList,
                                  string roomID) =>
{
    // Info of the member who left the room.
};
```

<Note title="Note">

When all members leave the room, the room will be automatically destroyed. ZIM SDK supports setting the room delay destruction through [ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig], with a maximum delay of 3 hours.
