# Delete conversations

- - -

## Introduction

ZIM supports users to delete a specific conversation or all conversations in the conversation list.


## Delete a conversation


To delete the specified conversation after login, call the [DeleteConversation](@DeleteConversation) with the `conversationID` parameter.

<Note title="Note">

When deleting a specified conversation:

- All messages in the conversation are not automatically deleted. If you need to delete both the conversation and all messages in the conversation, call the [DeleteConversation](@DeleteConversation) method. 
- If the conversation has unread messages, the total number of unread messages will be reduced and shown in the [OnConversationTotalUnreadMessageCountUpdated](@OnConversationTotalUnreadMessageCountUpdated) callback. For details, see the chapter **Get the number of unread messages** above.
</Note>

```c# title = "Sample code"
// Delete a conversation, following is an example of deleting a one-on-one conversation
ZIMConversationDeleteConfig config = new ZIMConversationDeleteConfig();
config.isAlsoDeleteServerConversation = true;

ZIM.GetInstance().DeleteConversation("CONV_ID", ZIMConversationType.Group, config,
    (string conversationID, ZIMConversationType conversationType,
                    ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Result of deleting the conversation
    });
