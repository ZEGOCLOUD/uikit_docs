# Integrate the ZIM Audio SDK


This topic describes how to integrate the ZIM Audio SDK.


## Prerequisites

Before you integrate the ZIM Audio SDK, make sure that the following conditions are met:
- Development environment:
    - Flutter or later is installed.
    - Dart is installed and the version is [2.12.0, 4.0.0).
    - The test device meets the following requirements:
        - iOS 11.0 or above iOS real phones.
        - For real Android devices running Android 4.1 or above, please turn on the "Allow debugging" option.

##  Import the ZIM Audio SDK

1. Open the "pubspec.yaml" file, in the "pub" format, and add the "zego_zim_audio" dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
    # Please check the latest version of the SDK from the release log and modify x.y.z to the specific version number.
    zego_zim_audio: ^x.y.z
```

2. After adding and saving the file, execute `flutter pub get` in the terminal.

## Setting permissions

Before using ZIM Audio SDK, please set microphone permissions to collect voice.

You can set the permissions required for applications based on actual application needs.

Enter the "app/src/main" directory, open the "AndroidManifest.xml" file, and add permissions.

```xml
<!-- Required permissions for the SDK -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

<Warning title="Warning">
Due to the requirement for Android 6.0 and higher versions to request dynamic permissions for some critical permissions, it is not enough to only apply for static permissions through the "AndroidManifest.xml" file. Therefore, you also need to refer to the following code, where "requestPermissions" is a method of the "Activity".
</Warning>

```java
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO) !=
            PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        String[] permissions = {Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO};
        requestPermissions(permissions, PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE);
    }
}
```

The specific permission details are as follows:

| Necessity           | Permission   | Description                 | Reason for Request                       |
| :------------------ | :----------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Required permission | RECORD_AUDIO | Audio recording permission. | This permission is needed to send audio. |

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prevent confusion

If you use the Flutter framework to develop Android applications, you also need to add the "-keep" class configuration to the SDK in the "proguard-rules.pro" file to prevent confusion with the SDK public class names.

```txt
-keep class **.zego.**{*;}
```
