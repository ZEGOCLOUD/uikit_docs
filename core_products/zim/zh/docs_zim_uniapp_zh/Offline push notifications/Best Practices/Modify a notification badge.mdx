### Report the badge number

When the receiving end is online, it needs to call the [setServerBadge](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zpns/latest/zego_zpns/ZPNs/setServerBadge.html) method to report the current badge number to the ZPNs server. When it receives a offline push notification, ZPNs will automatically update the badge number on the receiving end based on this value.

<Note title="Note">
The badge value must not be less than 0.
</Note>

```dart
// Report the badge number of the app as 1 to the ZPNs server.
ZPNs.getInstance().setServerBadge(1);
```

### Send offline push notifications with badge information

When sending messages or call invitations, the sender can modify the badge-related parameters in [ZIMPushConfig](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMPushConfig-class.html) to determine the changes in the badge on the receiving end.

```dart
ZIMPushConfig pushConfig = ZIMPushConfig();
// Whether the push notification carries badge information, default is false.
pushConfig.enableBadge = true;
// The badge increment for the target of this push notification. Set it as 1 here, which will increase the badge number of the receiving end app by 1.
pushConfig.badgeIncrement = 1;
```

### Update the badge automatically

After receiving offline push notifications, the ZPNs SDK will automatically adjust the app icon badge based on the badge information in the notifications.

### Update the badge automatically

Starting from [Android 8.0 (API level 26)](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/badges), the system will display a badge (a dot) by default after receiving a push notification from FCM.
