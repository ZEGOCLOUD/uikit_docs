# Callback configuration instructions

- - -

When using the In-app Chat server APIs, you can use callback services to interface with the business server, further ensuring orderly and normal business processes.

## Use cases


- After the client successfully sends a call invitation, the business server can receive the [Callback on call invitation sent](./Call%20invitation%20sent.mdx) from the In-app Chat server to confirm the success of the call invitation request.

- When the client successfully cancels a call invitation or logs out after successfully sending a call invitation or times out due to inactivity, the business server can receive the [Callback on call invitation canceled](./Call%20invitation%20canceled.mdx) from the In-app Chat server to determine the call status.

- When the callee accepts the call invitation, the business server can receive the [Callback on call invitation accepted](./Call%20invitation%20accepted.mdx) from the In-app Chat server to confirm the success of the acceptance request.


- When the callee rejects the call, the business server can receive the [Callback on call invitation rejected](./Call%20invitation%20rejected.mdx) from the In-app Chat server to confirm the success of the rejection request.


- After the call invitation is successfully sent, if the callee does not respond until the timeout time configured in the backend or the timeout time set when sending the call, the business server can receive the [Callback on call invitation timed out](./Call%20invitation%20timed%20out.mdx) from the In-app Chat server to determine the user who timed out.


## Callback configurations

You can configure the URL address for receiving callbacks in the **Project Configuration - Service Management - In-app Chat - Call invitation callbacks configuration** of [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) according to actual business needs.
