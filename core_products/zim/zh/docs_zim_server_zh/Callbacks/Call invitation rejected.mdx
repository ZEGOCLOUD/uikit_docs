# Callback on call invitation rejected

- - -

## Overview

After the callee rejects the call invitation, the business server can receive the callback on the call invitation rejected by the In-app Chat Server to determine the success of the call invitation request.

## Callback description

- Request method: POST.
<Note title="Note">

- The callback data needs to be decoded by UrlDecode.
- When using the POST request method to pass parameters:
  - The parameters in the body can be directly passed in the JsonObject format, without the need to serialize them into a string format.
  - In the headers, set "Content-type" to "application/json".
</Note>

- Request endpoint: The corresponding callback endpoint in the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com). 

- Protocol: HTTPS/HTTP (HTTPS is recommended.)

## Callback parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| appid | String | The unique identifier of the App.|
| event | String | Callback event, the return value of this callback is call_reject. |
| nonce | String | Random string. |
| signature | String | The verification string, see [Authenticating server-to-server callbacks](./Authenticating%20server-to-server%20callbacks.mdx) for details.|
| timestamp | Int | The current server time in Unix timestamp format. |
| call_id | String | Call invitation ID. |
| user_id | String | ID of the user that rejects the call invitation. |

<Note title="Note">

It is recommended that you convert some parameters to Int for logical processing. The relevant fields include `appid` and `nonce` (if they are already of type int, please ignore them).
</Note>

## Sample code

```json
{
    "appid": "1",
    "event": "call_reject",
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",
    "timestamp": 1499676978,
    "call_id": "3501761173612493269",
    "user_id": "abc",
    "extend_data": "extendData"
}
```

## Return codes

If an HTTP status code 2XX (for example, 200) is returned, the callback succeeded. Otherwise, the callback failed.

## Callback retry policy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the HTTP status code received by the ZEGOCLOUD server is not 2xx (such as 200), it will retry with intervals of 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the retry still fails after an interval of 32s, it will no longer retry.
