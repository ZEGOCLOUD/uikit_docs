# Callback on call invitation accepted

- - -

## Overview

After the callee accepts the call invitation, the business server can receive the callback on the call invitation accepted by the In-app Chat Server to determine the success of the call invitation acceptance request.

## Callback description

- Request method: POST.
<Note title="Note">

- The callback data needs to be decoded by UrlDecode.
- When using the POST request method to pass parameters:
  - The parameters in the body can be directly passed in the JsonObject format, without the need to serialize them into a string format.
  - In the headers, set "Content-type" to "application/json".
</Note>

- Request endpoint: The corresponding callback endpoint in the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com)

- Protocol: HTTPS/HTTP. HTTPS is recommended.

{
    "appid": "1",
    "event": "call_accept",
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",

```

## Return codes

A status code of 2XX (such as 200) indicates success, and other responses indicate failure.

## Callback retry policy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the HTTP status code received by the ZEGOCLOUD server is not 2xx (such as 200), it will retry with intervals of 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the retry still fails after an interval of 32s, it will no longer retry.
