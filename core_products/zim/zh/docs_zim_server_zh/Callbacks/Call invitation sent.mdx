# Callback on call invitation sent

---

## Overview

**When a user sends a call invitation to other users, it represents the creation of a call.**

Your server can receive the call creation callback from the ZIM server to obtain the details of the call invitation.

<Note title="Note">

1. If multiple users are called and one of them is logged out, the logged-out user is not included in the call creation callback.

2. If all called users are logged out, the call creation callback is not returned.

3. If the call inviation has been sent but the caller logs out or is indicated to be logged out by a heartbeat timeout, the business backend receives the call cancellation callback from the ZIM server. For more information, see [Call cancel callback](./Call%20invitation%20canceled.mdx).

</Note>

## Sample code

```json
{
    "appid": "1",
    "event": "call_create",
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",
    "timestamp": 1499676978,
    "call_id": "3501761173612493269",
    "user_ids": ["abc","def"],
    "create_time": 1499676968,
    "payload": "payload",
    "caller": "caller",
    "timeout": 90
}
```

## Return codes

If an HTTP status code 2XX (for example, 200) is returned, the callback succeeded. Otherwise, the callback failed.

## Callback retry policy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the HTTP status code received by the ZEGOCLOUD server is not 2xx (such as 200), it will retry with intervals of 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the retry still fails after an interval of 32s, it will no longer retry.
