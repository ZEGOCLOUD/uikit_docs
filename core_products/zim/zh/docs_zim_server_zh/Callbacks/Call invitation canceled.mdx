# Callback on call invitation canceled
- - -

## Overview

When the following situations occur (which can be divided into two types), your server can receive a callback on the call invitation cancellation from the ZIM server, in order to determine the call status:
- Cancelled by caller:
    - The caller cancels the call.
    - After the initialization of the call invitation and before its timeout, no callee accepts the invitation, and the caller logs out.
    - After the initialization of the call invitation and before its timeout, no callee accepts the invitation, and the caller goes offline due to heartbeat timeout.
-  Cancelled by timeout:
    - From the initialization of the call invitation to its timeout, no callee responds to the invitation, and the caller is still online.  

<Note title="Note">

From the initialization of the call invitation to its timeout, if no callee responds to the invitation, and the caller is still offline, it will trigger the   

If after the call is successfully created and before the call times out, if no call recipient responds and the calling user goes offline, it will trigger the [callback on call invitation timed out](./Call%20invitation%20timed%20out.mdx).

## Sample code
- POST/JSON

```json
{
    "appid": "1",
    "event": "call_cancel",
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",
    "timestamp": 1499676978,
    "call_id": "3501761173612493269",
    "user_ids": ["abc","def"],
    "reason": "caller_cancel",
    "payload": "payload",
}
```

## Return codes
If an HTTP status code 2XX (for example, 200) is returned, the callback succeeded. Otherwise, the callback failed.

## Callback retry policy


If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the HTTP status code received by the ZEGOCLOUD server is not 2xx (such as 200), it will retry with intervals of 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the retry still fails after an interval of 32s, it will no longer retry.
