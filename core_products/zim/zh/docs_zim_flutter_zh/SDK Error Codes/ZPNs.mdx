# ZPNs Error Codes


If the `errorCode` field exists in the return result after calling the ZPNs interface, it indicates that the interface call has encountered an exception. Example code is as follows:

```dart
ZPNsEventHandler.onRegistered = (ZPNsRegisterMessage registerMessage) {
  log(registerMessage.errorCode.toString());
};
```

Based on the operating device, the ZPNs Flutter SDK will return different error codes.

## iOS Error Codes
The ZPNs Flutter SDK passes through the error codes and messages returned by APNs. For more details, please refer to the [Apple Official Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkapplicationdelegate/3946536-didfailtoregisterforremotenotifi?language=objc).
