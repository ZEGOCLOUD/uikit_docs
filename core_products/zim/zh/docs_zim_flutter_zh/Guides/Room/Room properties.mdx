# Manage room properties

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides the capability of room property management, allowing you to customize the properties of a specified room.

With this feature, you can build your app to meet different requirements of various scenarios: customize the in-room properties in a live audio streaming or live chatroom, manage your speaker seats in a live audio room, mark player roles and the latest facts and figures in an online Werewolf and other online board games.

## Set room properties

To set room properties, set them when you call the [createRoom](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/createRoom.html) method to create a room.

```dart
Future<ZIMRoomCreatedResult> createRoom(ZIMRoomInfo roomInfo,[ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig? config]);
```

<Warning title="Warning">

- Up to 20 room properties can be set in a room. The room property is stored in the format of `Key-Value`. The maximum length of `Key` is 16 bytes, the maximum length of `Value` is 1024 bytes, and the total length of all properties must not exceed 5120 bytes. For more customizable room properties, contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support. 
- The customized room properties you set will be cleared after the room is destroyed.
</Warning>


<CodeGroup>
```dart title="Sample code"
ZIMRoomMemberQueryConfig roomMemberQueryConfig = ZIMRoomMemberQueryConfig();
roomMemberQueryConfig.count = 100;

ZIMRoomInfo roomInfo = ZIMRoomInfo();
roomInfo.roomID = 'roomID';
roomInfo.roomName = 'roomName';
ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig advancedConfig = ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig();
advancedConfig.roomAttributes = {'key': 'value'};

ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .createRoom(roomInfo,advancedConfig)
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```
</CodeGroup>
### Modify room properties

The room properties you set are stored as `key-value`.

- When Key does not exist: Setting room property means adding room property.
- When the Key already exists: Setting the room property means updating the value of the existing room property.


<CodeGroup>
```dart title="Sample code"
Map<String, String> roomAttributes = {'key': 'value'};
ZIMRoomAttributesSetConfig roomAttributesSetConfig = ZIMRoomAttributesSetConfig();
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .setRoomAttributes(roomAttributes, 'roomID', roomAttributesSetConfig)
    .then((value) {
      //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
      //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Delete room properties

Generally, you can only delete the room properties that you own. You can also delete the room properties created by others by setting the `isForce` value in `config`.


<CodeGroup>
```dart title="Sample code"
List<String> keys = ['key1', 'key2'];
ZIMRoomAttributesDeleteConfig roomAttributesDeleteConfig = ZIMRoomAttributesDeleteConfig();

ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .deleteRoomAttributes(keys, 'roomID', roomAttributesDeleteConfig)
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Get room properties


<CodeGroup>
```dart title="Sample code"
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .queryRoomAllAttributes('roomID')
    .then((value) {
      //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
      //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Combined room properties operation

The merge operation means that you can combine multiple operations within the same room into one operation using the [beginRoomAttributesBatchOperation](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/beginRoomAttributesBatchOperation.html) and [endRoomAttributesBatchOperation](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/endRoomAttributesBatchOperation.html) methods. This is typically used when you want to perform consecutive operations without being interrupted by other users' operations.

To know the operation results after making a combined room properties operation, you can check the return value of the class [ZIMRoomAttributesBatchOperatedResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMRoomAttributesBatchOperatedResult-class.html). 


<CodeGroup>
```dart title="Sample code"
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .beginRoomAttributesBatchOperation('roomID', batchOperationConfig)
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed. 
    });

ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .endRoomAttributesBatchOperation('roomID')
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```
