# Manage group members

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD's In-app Chat (the ZIM SDK) provides the capability of group member management, allowing you to query the group member list and group member info, change the group owner, and more.


<Warning title="Warning">

- Before you use the following features, you must join a group first. To join a group, refer to the Chapter **Join a group** of [Manage groups](./Manage%20groups.mdx).
</Warning>

## Get group member list


To know who is in the current group and get the group member list after login, call the [queryGroupMemberList](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/queryGroupMemberList.html) method. 

To know the results of the query, you can check the return value of the class [queryGroupMemberList](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/queryGroupMemberList.html).


#### Sample code

```dart
// Get group member list.
ZIMGroupMemberQueryConfig groupMemberQueryConfig =
      ZIMGroupMemberQueryConfig();
groupMemberQueryConfig.count = 100;

ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .queryGroupMemberList('groupID', groupMemberQueryConfig)
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```

## Get group member info

To know the info of a specified member after joining a group, call the [queryGroupMemberInfo](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/queryGroupMemberInfo.html)method.

To know the results of the query, you can check the return value of the class [ZIMGroupMemberInfoQueriedResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMGroupMemberInfoQueriedResult-class.html). 


#### Sample code


```dart
// Get group member info.
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .queryGroupMemberInfo('userID', 'groupID')
    .then((value) {
      //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
      //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```


## Set a nickname


To set a nickname after joining a group, call the [setGroupMemberNickname](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/setGroupMemberNickname.html) method.

<Warning title="Warning">

The group owner can set the nickname of all group members. But the group members can only set their own nicknames.
</Warning>

To know whether the nickname is set successfully, you can check the return value of the class [ZIMGroupMemberNicknameUpdatedResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMGroupMemberNicknameUpdatedResult-class.html).

#### Sample code


```dart
// Set a nickname. Note: The group owner can set the nickname of all group members. But the group members can only set their own nicknames. 
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .setGroupMemberNickname('nickname', 'forUserID', 'groupID')
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```



## Set a role for a group member


For a group owner to set a role for a group member, call the [setGroupMemberRole](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/setGroupMemberRole.html) method. You can set the group member to a regular member or admin.

After the setting is successful, the group owner can receive the results of the operation through the return value of the class [ZIMGroupMemberRoleUpdatedResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMGroupMemberRoleUpdatedResult-class.html).

Group members can receive notifications of user role changes through [onGroupMemberInfoUpdated](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMEventHandler/onGroupMemberInfoUpdated.html).

#### Description of group member roles and permissions

The ZIM SDK supports setting users as group owners, administrators, and regular members by default. In a group, the group owner has all **client permissions** and can perform all group functions. Administrators have most **client permissions**, while regular members have the fewest **client permissions**. The specific client permissions for each role are shown in the table below:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Client Permissions</th>
<th>Group Owner<br/>(corresponding enum value: 1)</th>
<th>Administrator<br/>(corresponding enum value: 2)</th>
<th>Regular Member<br/>(corresponding enum value: 3)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Modify group avatar, group name, group notice</th>
<td rowspan="2">Supported</td>
<td rowspan="2">Supported</td>
<td rowspan="2">Supported</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Modify group attributes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Modify group member nickname</th>
<td rowspan="9">Supported, can be used for all group role users</td>
<td rowspan="5">Supported, can be used for all regular members</td>
<td rowspan="2">Supported, can only be used for oneself</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Recall group member messages</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Kick out members</th>
<td rowspan="7">Not supported</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Mute individual group members</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Mute specific group roles</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Set group member roles</th>
<td rowspan="4">Not supported</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Transfer group ownership</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Dismiss the group</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Mute all members</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### setGroupMemberRole description


#### Sample code

```dart
// The group owner sets regular users as administrators.
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .setGroupMemberRole(2, 'forUserID', 'groupID')
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```


## Transfer the group ownership


For a group owner to transfer the group ownership, call the [transferGroupOwner](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/transferGroupOwner.html) method with the `toUserID` (the ID of the member you want to transfer the ownership to).

<Warning title="Warning">

- Only the group owner has permission to change the group owner.
- The member you want to transfer the ownership to must be in the group; otherwise, the operation fails.
</Warning>


All group members can be told whether the group owner is changed through the return value of the class [ZIMGroupOwnerTransferredResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMGroupOwnerTransferredResult-class.html).



#### Sample code


```dart
// Change the group owner.
ZIM
    .getInstance()
    .transferGroupOwner('toUserID', 'groupID')
    .then((value) {
        //This will be triggered when operation successful. 
    })
    .catchError((onError) {
        //This will be triggered when operation failed.
    });
```

 
### Set Group Member Mute Status

After logging into the ZIM SDK, users can mute or unmute specific members within the groups they manage. By calling the [muteGroupMembers](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/muteGroupMembers.html)interface, you can batch modify the mute status of up to 100 group members. The mute duration can be permanent or up to a maximum of 604,800 seconds (7 days).

<Note title="Note">

- Group owners can mute all group members, including themselves.
- If you need to increase the number of operations per request or extend the maximum mute duration, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support.
</Note>

After a successful setting, the operating user will receive a notification through  [ZIMGroupMembersMutedResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMGroupMembersMutedResult-class.html).

After muting or unmuting, all group members will receive  [onGroupMemberInfoUpdated](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMEventHandler/onGroupMemberInfoUpdated.html), which informs them of which members are unable to speak or have their mute status lifted in the group.

<Note title="Note">

If you want to mute certain group members , please refer [Manage groups - Mute group](./Manage%20groups.mdx#mute-or-unmute-a-group).
</Note>

```dart
try {
    bool isMute = true;
    List<String> userIDs = ['user_1','user_2','user_3'];
    String groupID = 'group_id';
    ZIMGroupMemberMuteConfig config = ZIMGroupMemberMuteConfig();
  // Mute duration of 30 seconds.
    config.duration = 30;
    ZIMGroupMembersMutedResult result = await ZIM.getInstance()!.muteGroupMembers(isMute, userIDs, groupID, config);
    // Developers can obtain mute result-related information from the parameters in the result.
} on PlatformException catch (onError){
    onError.code;//Handle according to the error code table.
    onError.message;//Error message.
}
```

### Query the list of muted members in a group


After logging into the ZIM SDK, if group members want to know the list of members muted in the group, they can call the [queryGroupMemberMutedList](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIM/queryGroupMemberMutedList.html) interface to query.

After a successful query, the operating user can retrieve specific information using [ZIMGroupMemberMutedListQueriedResult](https://pub.dev/documentation/zego_zim/latest/zego_zim/ZIMGroupMemberMutedListQueriedResult-class.html).

```dart
try {
    // Query the list of members muted in the group by group members.
  ZIMGroupMemberMutedListQueryConfig config = ZIMGroupMemberMutedListQueryConfig();
    //Get up to 100 members in one request
  config.count = 100;
    config.nextFlag = 0;
    ZIMGroupMemberMutedListQueriedResult result = await ZIM.getInstance()!.queryGroupMemberMutedList('gorupID', config);
} on PlatformException catch (onError){
    onError.code; // Handle according to the error code table.
    onError.message; // Error message.
}
```
