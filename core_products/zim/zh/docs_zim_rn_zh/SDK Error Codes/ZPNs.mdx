# ZPNs Error Codes

If the `errorCode` field exists in the return result after calling the ZPNs interface, it indicates that the interface call has encountered an exception. Example code is as follows:

```js
ZPNs.getInstance().on('registered', function(message) {
    console.log("[ZPNs] registered. pushID: " + message.pushID + ", error: " + message.errorCode)
});
```

Based on the operating device, the ZPNs React Native SDK will return different error codes.

## iOS Error Codes

The ZPNs React Native SDK passes through the error codes and messages returned by APNs. For more details, please refer to the [Apple Official Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkapplicationdelegate/3946536-didfailtoregisterforremotenotifi?language=objc).
