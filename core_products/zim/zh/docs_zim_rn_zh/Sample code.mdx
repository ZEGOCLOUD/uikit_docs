# Sample app

<Content2 />

## Prepare the environment

- React Native 0.60.0 or later
- A real iOS device that is running on iOS 11.0 or later and supports audio and video.
-  An Android device or Simulator that is running on Android 4.1 or later and supports audio and video. We recommend you use a real device (enable the "USB Debugging" option).
- Your device is connected to the internet.
- Configure Visual Studio Code, search for the "React Native Tools" extension and install it.

### Run the sample code

1. In Visual Studio Code, import the sample code package file.

2. Modify the `config.js` file under the `src/assets/js` folder with the AppID and AppSign that you get in the Prerequisites steps. 

    ```javascript
    export const appConfig = {
        appID: , // Fill in the AppID you get. 
        appSign: , // Fill in the AppSign you get. 
    }; 
    ```
    
    **If your project uses the "Token-based authentication mode", please go to the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) to get a temporary Token for debugging.**

3. Enter the root directory of the project, and run the `yarn install` to install dependencies. (for iOS devices, run the `pod install` command instead.)

4. If running the program on an iOS device, please navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the command `cd ios && pod install` to install dependencies.

5. In the root directory, run the `yarn ios` or the `yarn android` command to run the sample code.
