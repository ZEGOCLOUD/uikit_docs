## 2.6.0 Upgrade Guide

ZPNs 2.6.0 separates CallKit and makes it a separate plugin. If your project uses an older version of ZPNs, you need to integrate the zego-callkit-react-native plugin additionally to achieve compatibility after the upgrade.

1. Import the zego-callkit-react-native plugin.

   Developers can use npm to obtain the SDK.

   Go to the root directory of your project and execute the following command to install the dependencies.

   <Note title="Note">

   npm package download supports TypeScript (recommended).
   </Note>

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="npm"
   npm i zego-callkit-react-native
   ```
```bash title="yarn"
   yarn add zego-callkit-react-native
   ```
</CodeGroup>

2. Remove the obsolete Callkit dependency and rely on the new header files to achieve compatibility after the upgrade.

```javascript
import CallKit from 'zego-callkit-react-native';
```
