# Send and receive audio messages


This topic describes how to use the ZIM SDK and ZIM Audio SDK to send and receive audio messages.

<Warning title="Warning">
Before using this feature, please make sure you have [logged in to ZIM](./../Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx).
</Warning>


## Usage steps

The whole process mainly includes audio recording, sending, receiving, and playback. In this example, an audio message is sent from client A to client B:

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/in_app_chat/17472.png" /></Frame>

### 1. Initialize the ZIM Audio SDK


Call the [init](@init) method to initialize the ZIM Audio SDK before calling other methods of this SDK.

To only implement audio message sending and receiving, you can pass in an empty string for the parameter in this method.

To implement more features, pass in a license. For more information about how to obtain a license, see [Implement online authentication](./Implement%20online%20authentication.mdx).


```javascript
// Initialize the ZIM Audio SDK.
// In this scenario, no license is required.
ZIMAudio.getInstance().init("");
```

### 2. Listen for the callback

Implement the callback methods in [ZIMAudioEventHandler](@-ZIMAudioEventHandler) as needed. Take [onError](@onError) as an example.

```javascript
ZIMAudio.getInstance().on("onError",function(onError){
    console.log('onError,code:'+onError.code+"message:"+onError.message);
});
```


### 3. Record an audio file

#### 3.1 Start the recording

1. Call the [startRecord](@startRecord) method on the sending client to define the audio duration and the local absolute path to store the audio file, which must contain the filename and extension, for example, `xxx/xxx/xxx.m4a`. Only M4A and MP3 files are supported.

    ```javascript   
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().startRecord(ZIMAudioRecordConfig("path", maxDuration: 10 * 1000));

    // "path" is the absolute local path where the audio file is expected to be stored, including the file extension (only supports .m4a and .mp3), such as xxx/xxx/xxx.m4a

    // "maxDuration" is the maximum recording duration for the audio, in milliseconds.

    // The default is 60000 ms (i.e., 60 seconds). The maximum value should not exceed 120000 ms (i.e., 120 seconds).

    // This example indicates 10 times 1000 ms (i.e., 10 seconds).
    ```

2. Trigger the callback.
   
   - After the recording starts, listen for the [onRecorderStarted](@onRecorderStarted) callback on the sending client to update the UI.
     
        ```javascript
        onRecorderStarted: () => void;
        ```

   - The ZIM Audio SDK updates the recording progress once every 500 ms in the [onRecorderProgress](@onRecorderProgress) callback, indicating the duration of the recorded audio file, which can be used to update the UI.
     
        ```javascript
        onRecorderProgress: (currentDuration: number) => void;
        ```
   
   - If the recording fails due to an error, the ZIM Audio SDK sends a notification in the [onRecorderFailed](@onRecorderFailed) callback, and you can handle the failure based on this callback and the error codes specified in [ZIM Audio SDK error codes](./../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM%20Audio.mdx).
     
     ```javascript
     onRecorderFailed: (errorCode: ZIMAudioErrorCode) => void;
     ```

#### 3.2 Complete the recording

1. To complete the recording, call the [completeRecord](@completeRecord) method.
   
   <Note title="Note">
   - Make sure that you have received the [onRecorderStarted](@onRecorderStarted) callback before calling the [completeRecord](@completeRecord) method; otherwise, the recording is canceled, and an error is reported, indicating that the duration is too short.
   - If the recording is not completed or canceled, the ZIM Audio SDK automatically completes it when the duration reaches the maximum and triggers the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback.
   </Note>
    
    ```javascript
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().completeRecord();
    ```

2. After receiving the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback, you can find the specified absolute audio file path.

    ```javascript
    onRecorderCompleted: (totalDuration: number) => void;  // `totalDuration` indicates the total duration (ms) of the audio file.
   ```

#### 3.3 (Optional) Cancel the recording

1. To cancel the recording and delete the recorded audio, call the [cancelRecord](@cancelRecord) method.
   
    ```javascript
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().cancelRecord();
    ```

2. Calling the [cancelRecord](@cancelRecord) method triggers the [onRecorderCancelled](@onRecorderCancelled) callback to the sending client, which uses the callback to update the UI.
   
    ```javascript
    onRecorderCancelled: () => void;
    ```

#### 3.4 (Optional) Check whether the recording is in progress

To obtain the recording status, call the [isRecording](@isRecording) method.

```javascript
ZIMAudio.getInstance().isRecording().then((isRecording) => {
    console.log(isRecording);
});
```

### 4. Send the audio message


After the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback is triggered, build the [ZIMAudioMessage](@-ZIMAudioMessage) object (ZIM audio message) by using the specified absolute path and call the [sendMediaMessage](@sendMediaMessage) method to send the message. Below is the sample code for sending an audio message in a one-to-one chat.

```javascript
// The callback for recording completion.
ZIMAudio.getInstance().on("onRecorderCompleted",function(totalDuration){
    // Convert audio duration in milliseconds to ZIM seconds
    let second = Math.floor(totalDuration / 1000);
    // Create the audio message.
    /* Note: fileLocalPath is the absolute path of the local file. */
    var fileLocalPath = 'xxx/xxx.mp3';
    var conversationID = 'xxxx';
    var config = { priority: 1 };
    var notification = {
        onMessageAttached: function(message) {
            // todo: Loading
        },
        onMediaUploadingProgress: function(message, currentFileSize, totalFileSize) {
            // todo: upload progress
        }
    };

    mediaMessageObj = {
        fileLocalPath, 
        type: 13,
        audioDuration: second, 
    };
    // Send the audio message in a one-to-one chat.
    zim.sendMediaMessage(
        mediaMessageObj,
        conversationID,
        0,
        config,
        notification,
    );
});
```

For more information about the sending progress, see [Callback for the sending progress of rich media content](./../Guides/Messaging/Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#callback-for-the-sending-progress-of-rich-media-content).

### 5. Receive the audio message


Based on the conversation type (one-to-one chat, voice chatroom, or group chat), listen for the [onReceivePeerMessage](@onReceivePeerMessage), [onReceiveGroupMessage](@onReceiveGroupMessage) and [onReceiveRoomMessage](@onReceiveRoomMessage) callback on the receiving client to receive the audio message notification and then call the [downloadMediaFile](@downloadMediaFile) method to download the audio file to the local database.

Below is the sample code for receiving and downloading an audio message in a one-to-one chat.

```javascript
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    // Triggered when receiving a private chat message
    messageList.forEach(function (msg) {
        // If the message type is 13 (audio)
        if (msg.type == 13) {
            zim.downloadMediaFile(msg, 13, function(message, currentFileSize, totalFileSize) {}).then((result) => {
                result.message.fileLocalPath; // Download successful, get the absolute local path of the audio file
            });
        }
    });
});
```

For more information about the download progress, see [Callback for the downloading progress of rich media content](./../Guides/Messaging/Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#receive-rich-media-content).

### 6. Play the audio file

#### 6.1 Start the playback

1. To play the audio file, call the [startPlay](@startPlay) method on the receiving client to pass in the local absolute path of the audio file and set the routing type for audio output.

    ```javascript
    // Play the audio.
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().startPlay({filePath:"Fill in the local path of the audio file",routeType:ZIMAudioRouteType.speaker});
    ```

2. Trigger the callback.
   
   - Listen for the [onPlayerStarted](@onPlayerStarted) callback to update the UI.
     
        ```javascript
        onPlayerStarted: (totalDuration: number) => void; // `totalDuration` indicates the total duration (ms) of the audio file.
        ```
   
   - The ZIM Audio SDK updates the playback progress once every 500 ms in the [onPlayerProgress](@onPlayerProgress) callback, indicating the playback duration of the audio file, which can be used to update the UI.
     
        ```javascript
        onPlayerProgress: (currentDuration: number) => void;
        ```
   
   - If the playback fails due to an error, the ZIM Audio SDK sends a notification in the [onPlayerFailed](@onPlayerFailed) callback, and you can handle the failure based on this callback and the error codes specified in [ZIM Audio SDK error codes](./../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM%20Audio.mdx).
     
        ```javascript
        onPlayerFailed: (errorCode: ZIMAudioErrorCode) => void;
        ```

   - If the playback is interrupted by recording, an incoming call, or audio output device preemption, the ZIM Audio SDK sends the [onPlayerInterrupted](@onPlayerInterrupted) callback.
     
        ```javascript
        onPlayerInterrupted: () => void;
        ```
   
   - When the playback ends, the ZIM Audio SDK sends the [onPlayerEnded](@onPlayerEnded) callback.
     
        ```javascript
        onPlayerEnded: () => void;
        ```

3. (Optional) To switch the audio output device (loudspeaker or headphone) during playback, call the [setAudioRouteType](@setAudioRouteType) method.
   
    <Warning title="Warning">
   If the headphone is connected, this method does not take effect, and the audio is still output from the headphone.
    </Warning>

    ```javascript
    // Set the output device to the loudspeaker.
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().setAudioRouteType(ZIMAudioRouteType.speaker);
    ```

#### 6.2 (Optional) Stop the playback

1. To stop the playback, call the [stopPlay](@stopPlay) method.
   
    ```javascript
    ZIMAudio.getInstance().stopPlay();
    ```

2. Listen for the [onPlayerStopped](@onPlayerStopped) callback to update the UI. After the playback is stopped or ends, the ZIM Audio SDK releases the audio device.

    ```javascript
    onPlayerStopped: () => void;
    ```

### 7. Deinitialize the ZIM Audio SDK

If the audio feature is no longer in use, call the [uninit](@uninit) method to release resources.

```javascript
ZIMAudio.getInstance().uninit();
```
