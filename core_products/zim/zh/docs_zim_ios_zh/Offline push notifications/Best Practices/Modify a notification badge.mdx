# Modify a notification badge


## Overview

ZPNs supports offline push notification receiver app to update the app icon badge with the number of unread messages, reminding users of the unread message count.

## Prerequisites

- ZPNs SDK version 2.6.0 or above has been integrated and the function of offline push notification has been implemented. For details, please refer to this document [Implement offline push notification](./../Implement%20offline%20push%20notification.mdx).
- iOS device running iOS 11.0 or above.

## Report the badge number

When the receiving end is online, it needs to call the [setBadge](@setBadge) method to report the current badge number to the ZPNs server. When it receives a offline push notification, ZPNs will automatically update the badge number on the receiving end based on this value.

<Note title="Note">
The badge value must not be less than 0.
</Note>

```objc
// Report the badge number of the app as 1 to the ZPNs server.
[[ZPNs shared] setBadge:1];
```

## Send offline push notifications with badge information

When sending messages or call invitations, the sender can modify the badge-related parameters in [ZIMPushConfig](@-ZIMPushConfig) to determine the changes in the badge on the receiving end.

```objc
ZIMPushConfig *pushConfig = [[ZIMPushConfig alloc] init];
// Whether the push notification carries badge information, default is NO.
pushConfig.enableBadge = YES;
// The badge increment for the target of this push notification. Set it as 1 here, which will increase the badge number of the receiving end app by 1.
pushConfig.badgeIncrement = 1;
```

## Update the badge automatically

After receiving offline push notifications, the ZPNs SDK will automatically adjust the app icon badge based on the badge information in the notifications.

## More Information

### Modify the local badge

To modify the local badge when the user is online, you can call the iOS system interface `setApplicationIconBadgeNumber`. Then, you need to promptly call [setBadge](@setBadge) to report the operation, as mentioned in [the previous section](#update-the-badge-automatically).

```objc
// Modify the local badge number of the app as 1.
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setApplicationIconBadgeNumber:1];
```
