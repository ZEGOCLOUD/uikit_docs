| Receive push notifications while the app is in the foreground | When the app is in the foreground and receives an offline push notification, this notification will be triggered. | [willPresentNotification](/article/api?doc=zim_API~objective-c_ios~protocol~ZPNs#zp-ns-notification-center-will-present-notification-user-info-with-completion-handler) |
| Callback notification when the popup is clicked | When the app is in the background or has been killed, an offline push notification will trigger a system popup.
