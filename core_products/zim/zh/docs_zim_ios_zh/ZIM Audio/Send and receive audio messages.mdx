# Send and receive audio messages


This topic describes how to use the ZIM SDK and ZIM Audio SDK to send and receive audio messages.

<Warning title="Warning">
Before using this feature, please make sure you have [logged in to ZIM](./../Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx).
</Warning>

## Usage steps

The whole process mainly includes audio recording, sending, receiving, and playback. In this example, an audio message is sent from client A to client B:

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/in_app_chat/17472.png" /></Frame>

### 1. Import the header file
Import the `ZIMAudio.h` header file to your project.
```objective-c
#import <ZIMAudio/ZIMAudio.h>
```

### 2. Initialize the ZIM Audio SDK


Call the [initWithLicense](@initWithLicense) method to initialize the ZIM Audio SDK before calling other methods of this SDK.

To only implement audio message sending and receiving, you can pass in an empty string for the parameter in this method.

To implement more features, pass in a license. For more information about how to obtain a license, see [Implement online authentication](./Implement%20online%20authentication.mdx).

```objc
// Initialize the ZIM Audio SDK.
// In this scenario, no license is required.
[[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] initWithLicense:@""];
```

### 3. Listen for the callback

1. Create a class named [ZIMAudioEventHandler](@-ZIMAudioEventHandler) and implement the method in the [ZIMAudioEventHandler](@-ZIMAudioEventHandler) class.
   
   ```objc
   #import <ZIMAudio/ZIMAudio.h>
   
   @interface ZIMAudioEventHandler : NSObject<ZIMAudioEventHandler>
   
   + (instancetype)sharedInstance;
   
   @end
   
   @implementation ZIMAudioEventHandler
   
   + (instancetype)sharedInstance {
       static ZIMAudioEventHandler *instance = nil;
       static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
       dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
           instance = [[ZIMAudioEventHandler alloc] init];
       });
       return instance;
   }
   
   - (void)onError:(ZIMAudioError *)errorInfo{
       // Write the business logic.
   }
   @end
   ```

2. Call the [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler-ZIMAudio) class to listen for one of its instances.
   
   ```objc
   [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] setEventHandler:[ZIMAudioEventHandler sharedInstance]];
   ```

### 4. Record an audio file

#### 4.1 Start the recording

1. Call the [startRecordWithConfig](@startRecordWithConfig) method on the sending client to define the audio duration and the local absolute path to store the audio file, which must contain the filename and extension, for example, `xxx/xxx/xxx.m4a`. Only M4A and MP3 files are supported.
   
   ```objc
   ZIMAudioRecordConfig *config = [[ZIMAudioRecordConfig alloc] init];
   config.filePath = @""; // The local absolute path to store the audio file, with the extension, for example, `xxx/xxx/xxx.m4a`. Only M4A and MP3 files are supported.
   config.maxDuration = 10 * 1000; // The maximum duration (ms) of the recorded audio.
                                   // The default duration is 60,000 ms, that is, 60 seconds. The maximum duration is 120,000 ms, that is, 120 seconds.
                                   // In this example, the duration is 10 x 1,000 ms, that is, 10 seconds.
   [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] startRecordWithConfig:config];
   ```

2. Trigger the callback.
   
   - After the recording starts, listen for the [onRecorderStarted](@onRecorderStarted) callback on the sending client to update the UI.
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onRecorderStarted;
     ```
   
   - The ZIM Audio SDK updates the recording progress once every 500 ms in the [onRecorderProgress](@onRecorderProgress) callback, indicating the duration of the recorded audio file, which can be used to update the UI.
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onRecorderProgress:(int)currentDuration;
     ```
   
   - If the recording fails due to an error, the ZIM Audio SDK sends a notification in the [onRecorderFailed](@onRecorderFailed) callback, and you can handle the failure based on this callback and the error codes specified in [ZIM Audio SDK error codes](./../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM%20Audio.mdx).
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onRecorderFailed:(ZIMAudioErrorCode)errorCode;
     ```

#### 4.2 Complete the recording

1. To complete the recording, call the [completeRecord](@completeRecord) method.
   
<Note title="Note">
- Make sure that you have received the [onRecorderStarted](@onRecorderStarted) callback before calling the [completeRecord](@completeRecord) method; otherwise, the recording is canceled, and an error is reported, indicating that the duration is too short.
- If the recording is not <a href="#complete">completed</a> or <a href="#cancel">canceled</a>, the ZIM Audio SDK automatically completes it when the duration reaches the maximum and triggers the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback.
</Note>
   
```objc
[[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] completeRecord];
```
   
2. After receiving the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback, you can find the specified absolute audio file path.

   ```objc
   - (void)onRecorderCompleted:(int)totalDuration; // `totalDuration` indicates the total duration (ms) of the audio file.
   ```

#### 4.3 (Optional) Cancel the recording

1. To cancel the recording and delete the recorded audio, call the [cancelRecord](@cancelRecord) method.
   
   ```objc
   [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] cancelRecord];
   ```

2. Calling the [cancelRecord](@cancelRecord) method triggers the [onRecorderCancelled](@onRecorderCancelled) callback to the sending client, which uses the callback to update the UI.
   
   ```objc
   - (void)onRecorderCancelled;
   ```

#### 4.4 (Optional) Check whether the recording is in progress

To obtain the recording status, call the [isRecording](@isRecording) method.

```objc
BOOL isRecording = [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] isRecording];   
```

### 5. Send the audio message

After the [onRecorderCompleted](@onRecorderCompleted) callback is triggered, build the [ZIMAudioMessage](@-ZIMAudioMessage) object (ZIM audio message) by using the specified absolute path and call the [sendMediaMessage](@sendMediaMessage) method to send the message. Below is the sample code for sending an audio message in a one-to-one chat.

```objc
// The callback for recording completion.
- (void)onRecorderCompleted:(int)totalDuration{
    // Create the audio message.
    ZIMAudioMessage *audioMessage = [[ZIMAudioMessage alloc] initWithFileLocalPath:@"The absolute path of the recorded audio file" audioDuration:totalDuration];

    // Send the audio message in a one-to-one chat.
    ZIMMessageSendConfig *sendConfig = [[ZIMMessageSendConfig alloc] init];
    [[ZIM getInstance] sendMediaMessage:audioMessage toConversationID:@"One-to-one chat ID" conversationType:ZIMConversationTypePeer config:sendConfig notification:nil callback:^(ZIMMessage * _Nonnull message, ZIMError * _Nonnull errorInfo) {
        if(errorInfo.code == ZIMErrorCodeSuccess){
            // The message is sent successfully.
        }else{
            // Handle the error based on the corresponding error code table.
        }
    }];   
}  
```

For more information about the sending progress, see [Callback for the sending progress of rich media content](./../Guides/Messaging/Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#callback-for-the-sending-progress-of-rich-media-content).

### 6. Receive the audio message


Based on the conversation type (one-to-one chat, voice chatroom, or group chat), listen for the [receivePeerMessage](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=zim_API~objective-c_ios~protocol~ZIMEventHandler#zim-receive-peer-message-from-room-id), [receiveGroupMessage](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=zim_API~objective-c_ios~protocol~ZIMEventHandler#zim-receive-group-message-from-group-id), or [receiveRoomMessage](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=zim_API~objective-c_ios~protocol~ZIMEventHandler#zim-receive-room-message-from-room-id) callback on the receiving client to receive the audio message notification and then call the [downloadMediaFileWithMessage](@downloadMediaFileWithMessage) method to download the audio file to the local database.

Below is the sample code for receiving and downloading an audio message in a one-to-one chat.

```objc
// The `receivePeerMessage` callback is triggered when a one-to-one message is received.
 - (void)zim:(ZIM *)zim receivePeerMessage:(NSArray<ZIMMessage *> *)messageList fromUserID:(NSString *)fromUserID {
    // Traverse the list of received messages.
    for (ZIMMessage *message in messageList) {
        // The message is an audio message.
        if(message.type == ZIMMessageTypeAudio){
            
            ZIMAudioMessage *audioMessage = (ZIMAudioMessage *)message;

            // If the local path of the audio message is an empty string, call the download method.
            if([audioMessage.fileLocalPath isEqual:@""]){
                // If no local path exits, the audio message has not been downloaded to the local database.
                [[ZIM getInstance] downloadMediaFileWithMessage:audioMessage fileType:ZIMMediaFileTypeOriginalFile progress:^(ZIMMediaMessage * _Nonnull message, unsigned long long currentFileSize, unsigned long long totalFileSize) {
                    // Obtain the audio file download progress.
                } callback:^(ZIMMediaMessage * _Nonnull message, ZIMError * _Nonnull errorInfo) {
                    if(errorInfo.code == ZIMErrorCodeSuccess){
                         message.fileLocalPath; // Download succeeded. Obtain the local absolute path of the audio file.
                    }else{
                        // Download failed. Handle the error based on the corresponding error code table.
                    }
                }];
            }
            // If the local path of the audio file is not empty, use the local path.
            else{
                audioMessage.fileLocalPath; // The local absolute path of the audio file.
            }
        }
    }
}  
```

For more information about the download progress, see [Callback for the downloading progress of rich media content](./../Guides/Messaging/Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#receive-rich-media-content).

### 7. Play the audio file

#### 7.1 Start the playback

1. To play the audio file, call the [startPlayWithConfig](@startPlayWithConfig) method on the receiving client to pass in the local absolute path of the audio file and set the routing type for audio output.
   
   ```objc
   // Play the audio.
   
   // Configure playback settings.
   ZIMAudioPlayConfig *config = [[ZIMAudioPlayConfig alloc] init];
   config.filePath = @"";// Enter the local path of the audio file.
   config.routeType = ZIMAudioRouteTypeSpeaker; // `ZIMAudioRouteTypeSpeaker`: Play the audio from the loudspeaker.
                                                // `ZIMAudioRouteTypeReceiver`: Play the audio from the headphone.
   [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] startPlayWithConfig:config];
   ```

2. Trigger the callback.
   
   - Listen for the [onPlayerStarted](@onPlayerStarted) callback to update the UI.
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onPlayerStarted:(int)totalDuration; // `totalDuration` is the total duration (ms) of the audio file.
     ```
   
   - The ZIM Audio SDK updates the playback progress once every 500 ms in the [onPlayerProgress](@onPlayerProgress) callback, indicating the playback duration of the audio file, which can be used to update the UI.
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onPlayerProgress:(int)currentDuration;
     ```
   
   - If the playback fails due to an error, the ZIM Audio SDK sends a notification in the [onPlayerFailed](@onPlayerFailed) callback, and you can handle the failure based on this callback and the error codes specified in [ZIM Audio SDK error codes](./../SDK%20Error%20Codes/ZIM%20Audio.mdx).
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onPlayerFailed:(ZIMAudioErrorCode)errorCode;
     ```
   
   - If the playback is interrupted by recording, an incoming call, or audio output device preemption, the ZIM Audio SDK sends the [onPlayerInterrupted](@onPlayerInterrupted) callback.
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onPlayerInterrupted;
     ```
   
   - When the playback ends, the ZIM Audio SDK sends the [onPlayerEnded](@onPlayerEnded) callback.
     
     ```objc
     - (void)onPlayerEnded;
     ```

3. (Optional) To switch the audio output device (loudspeaker or headphone) during playback, call the [setAudioRouteType](@setAudioRouteType) method.
   
    <Warning title="Warning">
   If the headphone is connected, this method does not take effect, and the audio is still output from the headphone.
    </Warning>
   
```objc
   // Set the output device to the loudspeaker.
   [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] setAudioRouteType:ZIMAudioRouteTypeSpeaker];
   ```

#### 7.2 (Optional) Stop the playback

1. To stop the playback, call the [stopPlay](@stopPlay) method.
   
   ```objc
   [[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] stopPlay];
   ```

2. Listen for the [onPlayerStopped](@onPlayerStopped) callback to update the UI. After the playback is stopped or ends, the ZIM Audio SDK releases the audio device.
   
   ```objc
   - (void)onPlayerStopped;
   ```

### 8. Deinitialize the ZIM Audio SDK

If the audio feature is no longer in use, call the [uninit](@uninit) method to release resources.

```objc
[[ZIMAudio sharedInstance] uninit];
```
